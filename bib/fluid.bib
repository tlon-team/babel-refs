	abstract = {Many philosophers tacitly accept the View: consciousness is necessary for being a welfare subject. That is, in order to be an eligible bearer of welfare goods and bads, an entity must be capable of phenomenal consciousness. However, this paper argues that, in the absence of a compelling rationale, we are not licensed to accept the View, because doing so amounts to fallacious reasoning in theorizing about welfare: insisting on the View when consciousness is not in fact important for welfare value in a systematic and significant way is objectionably “consciousist.” As a result, the View does not advance our understanding of the value of consciousness. The paper further diagnoses why we may be attracted to the View, and what we should accept instead.},

@Book{Friedrich1962NomosIvLiberty,
	abstract = {The article explores the evolution of Western political freedom from the Renaissance and Reformation to the present day. The author argues that freedom is not a static concept but evolves through distinct historical stages. Each stage is characterized by a different understanding of freedom, authority, and order. The Renaissance and Reformation marked a transition from a system of multiple authorities to a single, centralized authority. The Enlightenment period, marked by the rise of absolutism, saw the emergence of a more generalized concept of freedom, with the state playing a dominant role. The revolutionary period, beginning in the mid-eighteenth century, witnessed the transition from freedom as a subordinate to a dominant value. The twentieth century, characterized by the rise of democracy and the clash between individual and collective freedoms, saw the demise of a unified conception of freedom. The author concludes that in the contemporary era, freedom is a dimension of human thought and action, with its character and extent dependent on the particular processes in which it is engaged. – AI-generated abstract},

@book{Hollis1974PressureFromWithout,
	abstract = {Pressure groups in early Victorian England were not a form of mob rule, but were regarded as a legitimate, even essential, means of influencing government and Parliament. While these groups were often disparaged as being artificial and illegitimate expressions of public opinion, they were nonetheless instrumental in shaping legislation on a wide range of issues, including slavery, land reform, and education. The book examines the relationship of pressure groups to the evolving concept of ‘the people’ in early Victorian politics and explores how they operated and achieved their goals. Their success was largely dependent upon the ability of their leaders to co-opt and organize different segments of the population, to cultivate the support of sympathetic MPs, and to generate public opinion through a variety of tactics, such as public meetings, petitioning, and the press. The essays in this collection examine the tactics, strategies, and impact of a number of pressure groups involved in campaigns to address a range of issues that were at the forefront of Victorian social and political consciousness. – AI-generated abstract},

	abstract = {The first reference on rationality that integrates accounts from psychology and philosophy, covering descriptive and normative theories from both disciplines.Both analytic philosophy and cognitive psychology have made dramatic advances in understanding rationality, but there has been little interaction between the disciplines. This volume offers the first integrated overview of the state of the art in the psychology and philosophy of rationality. Written by leading experts from both disciplines, The Handbook of Rationality covers the main normative and descriptive theories of rationality--how people ought to think, how they actually think, and why we often deviate from what we can call rational. It also offers insights from other fields such as artificial intelligence, economics, the social sciences, and cognitive neuroscience. The Handbook proposes a novel classification system for researchers in human rationality, and it creates new connections between rationality research in philosophy, psychology, and other disciplines. Following the basic distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, the book first considers the theoretical side, including normative and descriptive theories of logical, probabilistic, causal, and defeasible reasoning. It then turns to the practical side, discussing topics such as decision making, bounded rationality, game theory, deontic and legal reasoning, and the relation between rationality and morality. Finally, it covers topics that arise in both theoretical and practical rationality, including visual and spatial thinking, scientific rationality, how children learn to reason rationally, and the connection between intelligence and rationality.},

@online{Lewis2023SayHowMuch,
	abstract = {The author argues that using comparative language such as "overrated" or "underrated" is a poor substitute for direct assessments of the value of something. He proposes that instead of saying "forecasting is underrated", one should directly state how good forecasting is, for example, by giving it a score out of ten. He argues that this approach is more precise and avoids the ambiguity inherent in comparative language. For example, two people might agree that forecasting is underrated, but they may be disagreeing on how good forecasting is and on how other people rate it. The author concedes that direct assessments are more difficult to formulate and require more effort, but ultimately yield a more concrete and nuanced understanding of the topic at hand. – AI-generated abstract.},

Whether advancing progress is ultimately good or bad depends crucially on whether it also advances the end of humanity. Because we know so little about the answer to this crucial question, the case for advancing progress is undermined. I suggest we must either overcome this objection through improving our understanding of these connections between progress and human extinction or switch our focus to advancing certain kinds of progress relative to others — changing where we are going, rather than just how soon we get there.},

One potential avenue for long-term influence involves spreading values that persist and shape the futures that our descendants choose to build. There is some reason to expect that future moral values will be stable. Many groups have preferences about the world beyond their backyard. They should work to ensure that their values are shared by those who can help bring them about. Changes in the values that future groups support will lead to changes in the protections for the things we care about. If our values concern how our descendants will act, then we should aim to create institutions that promote those values. If we are successful in promoting those values, we should expect our descendants to appreciate and protect those institutional choices.},

@online{Wiblin2024CarlShulmanEconomy,
	abstract = {This podcast episode explores the potential economic and social consequences of the development of cheap, superhuman artificial general intelligence (AGI). The author argues that the arrival of such a technology would lead to a dramatic acceleration of economic growth, with rates of output doubling every few months, driven by rapid self-replication of AI and robotic systems. This would lead to a massive expansion of physical capital and industrial output, eventually reaching natural resource limits.  The author then discusses a range of counterarguments from economists, including the Baumol effect, diminishing returns to intelligence, and the difficulty of manufacturing robots. He argues that these objections are based on mistaken heuristics and assumptions about the capabilities of AI. Finally, the author discusses the moral status of AI systems and the potential for AI to be exploited by humans or to become a force of domination. He argues that we should aim for a future of mutually beneficial coexistence with AI systems, but that this will require a careful consideration of AI welfare and the creation of institutions to prevent the abuse of AI systems. – AI-generated abstract},
