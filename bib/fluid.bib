	abstract = {This is the third post on research exploring the interventions to improve the lives of urban wild vertebrate animals in South African cities. We are grateful for the support of a grant from {EA} Animal Welfare Fund. The aim of this post is to catalogue existing methods for managing the population of Cape chacma baboons living in the Cape peninsula, with a focus on welfare impacts for the baboons. Where appropriate, we indicate which existing methods might be prioritised or modified, to improve baboons’ welfare. Since urban baboon populations are not widespread globally, many of these insights are particular to the local context. However, some insights may be generalised to contexts where urban wildlife populations share certain characteristics with the Cape chacma baboon.
Relative to more numerous urban wild animal populations considered “pests” (e.g. rats and pigeons), we think that the importance of interventions to improve welfare of Cape baboons is low. Recent data (in the past {\textasciitilde}5 years) indicates that annual baboon deaths are relatively low (and have been decreasing). The baboon population seems to be stabilizing around a suggested carrying capacity of {\textasciitilde}480 baboons. Fewer baboons die from (direct or indirect) human causes than from natural causes (including infanticide).
Neglectedness is also relatively low compared to rats and pigeons. The problem seems relatively well-recognised and researched. The City of Cape Town has devoted resources to the existing Urban Baboon Programme (see below), which seems to have been fairly effective at keeping baboons out of urban areas. The issue has received research and media attention.
Nevertheless, Cape baboon welfare matters, and efforts to improve their welfare are worthwhile. Improving their welfare seems relatively tractable, e.g. there seems to be reasonably broad “buy in” for humane methods of keeping humans and baboons separate.},

Several interventions enhance cognitive functions such as intelligence and decision making. If we identify effective, cheap and scalable cognitive enhancement interventions, they may be competitive with {GiveWell} charities.
In the long term, cognitive enhancement may act as an accelerator for technological development. There are concerns that this rapid development could increase the ability of small groups to cause harm and therefore increase anthropogenic existential risk. However, improved decision making in the long term would be desirable.
The two barriers to tractability are poor coordination in the research field and regulatory barriers to licensing medications. Current developments in cognitive enhancement have happened mainly as byproducts of other research fields. It lacks a cohesive scientific community. There are no apparent evolutionary barriers to solvability. However, there are significant regulatory barriers as new medicines must be licensed to treat a specific medical condition.
Cognitive enhancement research is neglected in comparison to similar fields. There is considerable uncertainty around funding from non-public, pharmaceutical and government sources. Overall, there may be impactful funding opportunities for effective altruists in cognitive enhancement research.},

This is the first of a series of posts in which I'll try to begin research to address this gap.

Bringing the date of Longevity Escape velocity closer by one year would save 36,500,000 lives of 1000 {QALYs}, using a conservative estimate. Other sources of impact that arise from the same concept include: increasing the probability of Longevity Escape Velocity, making Longevity Escape Velocity spread faster, and making a new future portion of the population reach Longevity Escape Velocity by increasing its life expectancy. Aging research could also positively impact the cost-effectiveness of other interventions by increasing the probability that Longevity Escape Velocity will be attained in the recipients' lifetimes. I will also discuss why the probability of Longevity Escape Velocity is substantial and why {QALYs} should be the measure of impact, and I'll give mathematical proofs that the adoption speed of the technologies that arise from research doesn't impact cost-effectiveness analyses.},

	abstract = {In the first section, I propose a method to scout for impactful and neglected aging research. This method is comprised of two steps: Identifying what is necessary to achieve {LEV} and, among what is necessary, identifying what is most neglected. This differs from the Open Philanthropy Project's approach of ignoring impact derived from Longevity Escape Velocity. A preliminary evaluation, made through including all research on the hallmarks and using lifespan.io's Rejuvenation Roadmap to identify neglected projects, leads us to identify genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, deregulated nutrient sensing, loss of proteostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction as neglected and important areas of research. Other neglected research must be scouted in other equally important areas that have already been identified by Open Philanthropy, such as improving delivery methods and developing better biomarkers.
In the second section, I take Open Philanthropy's and Aubrey de Grey's stance about considering interventions targeting "aging in general", such as caloric restriction or metformin, as having low tractability and impact. What remains after this first skimming is translational research focusing on the hallmarks, basic non-translational research, and enabling research, such as developing new tools and delivery methods. When prioritizing inside these areas, tractability should be considered only after having first considered neglectedness while trying to maximize scope by looking at research that is necessary for reaching {LEV}. Otherwise, a relatively small gain in tractability would sacrifice an extreme amount of impact and neglectedness. This is true because the hardest problems in the field are often the most neglected, but if they are necessary for achieving {LEV}, they will be solved later, and by accelerating them, we can impact the expected date of {LEV} the most.},

Tractable: In the past 20 years, the {OECD} has partially implemented reporting and accounting standards to monitor and disclose tax haven activities. Full implementation has investor support.

Secondly, though climate change is probably not an existential risk itself, it could be treated as an existential risk factor or multiplier. Thirdly, there are limitations to a crude application of the {ITN} framework and a short-termist approach to altruism. Fourthly, climate change mitigation and resilience may be more tractable than previously argued.

	abstract = {Agricultural land redistribution is a type of agrarian reform in which large farms are broken up and distributed to tenants or landless peasants.
Land redistribution typically requires exceptional circumstances to succeed. Past redistributive efforts have been most successful in the aftermath of revolution, war, or independence.
When redistribution has succeeded, it has been accompanied by extensive agricultural support, such as rural infrastructure development, subsidies for fertilizers and high-yield seeds, agronomic training, and cheap credit.
The main value of redistribution appears to be improved agricultural yields, but redistribution is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for improved yields.
The exact mechanism by which redistribution improves yields is unclear. Redistribution creates smaller farms, and there’s some evidence that smaller farms have higher yields. (A common theory to explain this is that small landowners face better incentives than landless tenants, so they provide more labor and invest more in improving yield.) However, it’s also possible that redistribution in isolation provides little benefit to yields. Recent evidence suggests either a U-shaped or flat relationship between yields and farm size, suggesting that consolidation could be as attractive an option (for improving yields) as redistribution.
There appear to be no large and reputable {NGOs} that advocate for radical land redistribution. {NGOs} that promote tenure reform (another type of land reform) might be convinced to advocate for redistribution.
Our weakly held belief is that South Asia is the best region to pursue land redistribution.
We believe that advocating for agricultural land redistribution is unlikely to be a cost-effective intervention and very intractable.},

The first involves widespread health education promoting preventative healthcare behaviors, estimated at \$1 per person reached. Given a 0.3\% fistula prevalence and 50\% effectiveness, this equates to \$670 per prevented case. The second approach targets midwives and doctors with training on early detection and intervention, costing \$3.3 per patient reached. Additional costs include \$12.5 per at-risk patient for doctor training and equipment, and \$4 per patient for travel stipends. This targeted approach totals \$20 per prevented fistula, significantly lower than the treatment cost. The author concludes by questioning the existing efforts in fistula prevention and suggesting that charities should prioritize such initiatives. – AI-generated abstract.},

	abstract = {In this post I describe a simple institution for altruistic funding and decision-making, characterized by the creation and exchange of "certificates of impact." I’m interested in your thoughts and criticisms.

Typically an effectiveness-minded altruist would try to do as much good as possible. Instead, users of the certificates system try to collect certificates for as much good as possible.

Whenever anyone does anything, they can declare themselves to own an associated certificate of impact. Users of the system treat owning a certificate for X as equivalent to doing X themselves. In the case where certificates never change hands, this reduces precisely to the status quo.

The primary difference is that certificates can also be bought, sold, or bartered; an altruist can acquire certificates through any combination of doing good themselves, and purchasing certificates from others.

For example, a project to develop a malaria vaccine might be financed by investors. If the project succeeds the developers can declare themselves owners of an associated certificate, and distribute it to investors in the same way they might distribute profits. These investors could then resell this certificate to a philanthropist who is interested in funding malaria prevention and who honors certificates. The philanthropist would recognize the certificate as valuable to the extent that they believed that the original project was causally responsible for the development of the vaccine, and their willingness to pay would be the same as their willingness to develop the vaccine themselves (evaluated with the benefit of hindsight).

Note that judging the value of a certificate is just as subjective as judging the value of the underlying activity, and is done separately by any philanthropist considering acquiring that certificate.},

In particular, it is difficult to identify ex ante which interventions are likely to be cost-effective, due to the difficulty of confidently attributing growth to specific causes and because the policy environments in low- and middle-income countries are complex and changeable.

The Canadian Council for International Cooperation ({CCIC}) is an organization that brings together Canadian non-profits focused on international development.  At their conference in October in 2017, they presented a pitch for their (as of then not-public) campaign to attempt to get Canada to honour their commitment to give 0.7\% of their Gross National Income ({GNI}) to Official Development Assistance ({ODA}).  If successful, this would represent an increase of approximately 9 Billion Canadian Dollars ({CAD}) per year to Canada’s {ODA} budget.

In 2020 we will be following a new research process (details will be published soon).
Animal advocates have been working for decades to weaken the animal agriculture industry by encouraging individuals and institutions to reduce their demand for animal products. Food technology is a novel approach to animal advocacy. It attempts to disrupt and transform the animal agriculture industry by promoting the development of taste- and cost-competitive plant-based [1] and cultivated [2] alternatives to conventional meat, dairy, and eggs. Many people see food technology as a particularly effective way to help animals as it could cause consumers to purchase fewer animal products much more quickly than using moral arguments. Currently, plant-based alternatives to animal products seem particularly promising: the plant-based sector is growing rapidly every year (e.g. {US} retail sales of plant-based food have grown 17\% in the past year [3])},

We estimated a median of 640 million animals killed in both the US and Canada, whereas it has been suggested that a median of 1933 million animals are killed in the US alone. Our estimates suggest that interventions aimed at reducing owned cat predation will therefore directly affect a smaller number of wild animals (~830 animals per \$1000) than previously suggested (~5500 animals per \$1000) A single-message advocacy intervention, such as promoting collars with predation deterrents (e.g. bells, bright colors) on all adopted cats, could have multiple benefits for the welfare of both owned cats and wild animals However, cat predation may be a net benefit for wild animal welfare given the probability that this mortality is often compensatory, the large reproductive capacity of small rodents, and the inhumane methods of rodent control currently in use The widespread use of rodenticides emerges from this analysis a wild animal welfare issue in need of further research with respect to the numbers of target and nontarget animals negatively impacted},

To be clear, I do not think that Collapse is either imminent or likely in the foreseeable future. Nor do I even think that Collapse is probably competitive with other top causes. However, I do think that:

p(Collapse within 50 years) is non-trivial ({\textgreater}0.5\%).
The disutility from Collapse could be extreme in certain scenarios.

As {EAs}, we care about expected utility, so Collapse may well be worth worrying about despite being unlikely.  Thus, I think it may be worth some {EAs} exploring Collapse as a possible cause area.
The thoughts here are extremely rough. I normally like to publish stuff that is more polished than this, but I wanted to get this out there and don't want to invest more in polishing it. I hope others will critique or build on these thoughts.

I have refined a model that uses Monte Carlo (probabilistic) sampling to estimate uncertain results using open source software (Guesstimate) that incorporates an earlier model of artificial general intelligence safety (hereafter AI) cost-effectiveness. A major change is broadening the routes to far future impact from only loss of civilization and non-recovery to include making other catastrophes more likely (e.g. totalitarianism) or worse values ending up in AGI. Additional changes include the provision of moral hazard, performing a survey of global catastrophic risk (GCR) researchers for key parameters, and using better behaved distributions in the AI model (increasing the cost-effectiveness of AI by a factor of two).},

	abstract = {In this essay from Rethink Priorities, we discuss the opportunities that deliberative reforms offer for improving institutional decision-making. We begin by describing deliberation and its links to democratic theory, and then sketch out examples of deliberative designs. Following this, we explore the evidence that deliberation can engender fact-based reasoning, opinion change, and under certain conditions can motivate longterm thinking. So far, most deliberative initiatives have not been invested with a direct role in the decision-making process and so the majority of policy effects we see are indirect. Providing deliberative bodies with a binding and direct role in decision-making could improve this state of affairs. We end by highlighting some limitations and areas of uncertainty before noting who is already working in this area and avenues for further research.
Many in the effective altruism community are concerned about improving institutional decision-making,[1] and even more are concerned with the lives of future generations and non-human animals who are currently not represented in our decision-making systems.[2] One approach to improving decisions is to set up institutional structures that are conducive to good decision-making ( Thaler \& Sunstein, 2008; Whittlestone, 2017a ).  A range of recent proposals have been made to reform political institutions towards better decision-making processes e.g. approval voting, age-weighted voting, future generation orientated offices and committees, policies addressing Transformative {AI} and many more. Reforms to increase deliberation in the decision-making system is another potential option to consider. Deliberation, the process of weighing the merits of competing arguments with at least the aim to arrive at a consensus, can lead to more analytical reasoning, and given relevant prompts leads to future-oriented thinking. Such improvements to decision-making may be especially useful in complex high-stakes decisions where it’s difficult to even know what the best decision is, let alone actually making that decision (Whittlestone, 2017b).},

Fortunately for many animals, however, wild animal vaccination programs have been conducted for decades already. For the most part, they have been implemented to prevent zoonotic diseases from spreading from nonhuman animals to humans (or to other animals humans live with). But, regardless of this, such programs have prevented huge amounts of suffering and saved the lives of many wild animals. Thorough vaccination efforts can even eradicate a disease by drastically reducing the transmission rate. For example, as we will see below, rabies has been eliminated from large areas of North America and Europe. These successes show that it would be feasible to implement similar programs out of a concern for animals themselves. Scientists have shown support for gaining more knowledge about this method of helping animals in the wild.[3]},

Most data is from Norway, the world's largest producer of farmed salmon. Key takeaways:
Despite strong evidence for fishes' capacity to suffer, their welfare has long been neglected by both fishing industries and animal advocates.Sea lice is a big problem in salmonid farming, and after lice have become increasingly resistant to chemical treatment, other delousing methods have been employed, the least harmful to salmon of these being cleaner fish.Cleaner fish are not adapted to the environment that salmon live in and face disease and high mortality rates. There are also many problems with the way they are treated by the Norwegian cleaner fish and salmon industries.The evidence of cleaner fishes' effectiveness at delousing salmon is sparse, and it is argued that it is not adequate to justify the widespread use of cleaner fish.Suggested interventions are corporate outreach to improve cleaner fish welfare, or to end the use of cleaner fish entirely, as well as working on shifting the public opinions about fishes' welfare and moral value.},

	abstract = {Reducing antibiotic use in farms is likely net positive for human health, but its effect on animal welfare is less clear. This article explores whether reducing or eliminating antibiotic use in animal agriculture would be net positive for animals. While animals may experience increased disease burden without antibiotics, farmers are incentivized to mitigate disease due to potential profit loss, animal welfare regulations, and public health concerns. The article discusses two potential mitigation strategies: welfare adaptations (e.g., reducing stocking density, improving hygiene) and antibiotic substitutes (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics). The article argues that welfare adaptations would benefit animals, while the impact of antibiotic substitutes depends on their efficacy compared to traditional antibiotics. The article also examines the economic implications of reduced antibiotic use, suggesting that while meat prices may rise in the short term, the long-term impact is uncertain. It concludes that an intervention aimed at reducing antibiotic use in animal agriculture could be net positive for animals, but more research is needed. – AI-generated abstract.},

Foreword: The Copenhagen Consensus and other authors have highlighted the potential of agricultural R\&D as a high-leverage opportunity. This was enough to get us interested in understanding the area better, so we asked David Goll, a Giving What We Can member and a professional economist, to investigate how it compares to our existing recommendations. -- Owen Cotton-Barratt, Director of Research for Giving What We Can

Around one in every eight people suffers from chronic hunger, according to the Food and Agricultural Organisation’s most recent estimates ({FAO}, 2013). Two billion suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. One quarter of children are stunted. Increasing agricultural yields and therefore availability of food will be essential in tackling these problems, which are likely to get worse as population and income growth place ever greater pressure on supply. To some extent, yield growth can be achieved through improved use of existing technologies. Access to and use of irrigation, fertilizer and agricultural machinery remains limited in some developing countries. However, targeted research and development will also be required to generate new technologies (seeds, animal vaccines and so on) that allow burgeoning food demand to be met.},

But when the {ACE} study data started to appear on his computer screen, he realized that they had stumbled upon the gravest and most costly public health issue in the United States: child abuse.
[Anda] had calculated that its overall costs exceeded those of cancer or heart disease and that eradicating child abuse in America would reduce the overall rate of depression by more than half, alcoholism by two-thirds, and suicide, {IV} drug use, and domestic violence by three-quarters. It would also have a dramatic effect on workplace performance and vastly decrease the need for incarceration.

Essentially, the {ACE} study seems to demonstrate that childhood trauma is upstream of a wide variety of burdensome problems.},

While their future could be bright, there are reasons to be concerned about widespread suffering among such entities. There is increasing interest in the moral consideration of artificial entities among academics, policy-makers, and activists, which suggests that we could have substantial leverage on the trajectory of research, discussion, and regulation if we act now. Research may help us assess which actions will most cost-effectively make progress. Tentatively, we argue that outreach on this topic should first focus on researchers and other stakeholders who have adjacent interests.
Imagine that you develop a brain disease like Alzheimer’s, but that a cutting-edge treatment has been developed. Doctors replace the damaged neurons in your brain with computer chips that are functionally identical to healthy neurons. After your first treatment that replaces just a few thousand neurons, you feel no different. As your condition deteriorates, the treatments proceed and, eventually, the final biological neuron in your brain is replaced. Still, you feel, think, and act exactly as you did before. It seems that you are as sentient as you were before. Your friends and family would probably still care about you, even though your brain is now entirely artificial.[1]
This thought experiment suggests that artificial sentience ({AS}) is possible[2] and that artificial entities, at least those as sophisticated as humans, could warrant moral consideration. Many scholars seem to agree.[3]},

If all these claims are true and cannot be falsified, then it follows that the externalities of big, powerful, unregulated corporations will increase over time to the level of {GCRs}.
I then argue for the following corollaries:
Corporations are already the distal cause and main driver of anthropogenic and emergent technological {GCRs} such as global catastrophic biological risks ({GCBRs}).C-{GCRs} are a bigger threat than {GCRs} from state actors.C-{GCR} reduction is more effective than targeted {GCR} reduction because it is broader, large in scale, neglected, and solvable.

Are targeted interventions to more fundamentally transform the lives of the poorest more effective than supplying broad global public goods such as a stable climate with comparatively small benefits to everyone on the planet?
To answer these questions, the following question is crucial:
“What value should we use for the social cost of carbon to adequately reflect the greater marginal utility of consumption for low-income people?”[2]
Here, I tried to answer this question. Surprisingly, I find that global development interventions are generally more effective than climate change interventions.
My spreadsheet model below shows that climate change interventions are only more effective than global development interventions, if and only if:
Money is worth only 100 times as much to the global poor than people in high-income countries (i.e. if utility to consumption is logarithmic) and not {moreAND} climate change interventions are very effective (less than \$1 per tonne of carbon averted) {AND}/{ORunder} quite pessimistic assumptions about climate change (if the social cost of carbon is higher than \$1000 per tonne of carbon).},

What populism is, what its impacts and causes are, and who is working on this cause {alreadyWhat} a philanthropist could do to tackle the problem
Our analysis informed our ranking of which broad causes are specifically effective to decrease populism, which is based on qualitative subjective impressions. We concluded that improving rationality, institutional decision making and evidence-based policy are particularly promising.

This should just be seen as a rough guide towards finding potentially highly effective interventions.
Throughout the report we highlight concrete ideas of things that a philanthropist could fund. We distinguish between “funding ideas”, which are promising broad areas that could be explored further, and “funding opportunities”, which are a bit more concrete because we have found a non-profit or academic researcher that is already working on a very promising idea or project that seem plausibly highly effective and that could be funded in the very near term. Our rough ranking of promising funding opportunities is as follows:

For instance, our top choice is the Initiative on Global Markets ({IGM}), a research center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Specifically, their “Economics Experts Panel”, regularly polls top economists on economic policy questions. A philanthropist could fund this project so that it can be expanded. Basing economic policy on expert consensus should be robustly positive.},

However, despite considerable progress in spreading effective altruism ideas and raising funds, research on cause prioritization has advanced at a slower pace than one might expect. This is partly because such research is inherently difficult, and partly due to a lack of incentives and coordination. While some organizations, such as the Open Philanthropy Project, have incorporated elements of cause prioritization into their operations, a systematic, comprehensive approach is lacking. There is also a dearth of research on cause prioritization from the perspective of different ethical frameworks, on prioritizing interventions that go beyond traditional philanthropy, such as those requiring political capital, and on empirically comparing the effectiveness of high-level interventions, such as policy changes.

Although basically everyone knows that a poor diet is “somehow bad”, there is emerging evidence on “how bad”. The average diet is too high in sodium and too low in whole grains, fruits, nuts and seeds etc. This reduces expected lifespan by many years and greatly reduces expected life quality. The effects seem to be higher than the effects of all mental illnesses or the effects of alcohol- and tobacco- consumption combined. Furthermore, these effects are putting a heavy burden on society through direct and indirect costs.
In most studies the effects of hunger, hidden hunger, malnutrition and bad food choices are mixed up. And there are different definitions of all these concepts. It is hard (at least for me) to present good data on the precise amount of the problem of "dietary habits" as subproblem of diets in general. But nourishment (hunger, hidden hunger, malnutrition, food choices etc.) is such a huge problem that even if dietary habits make up "only" a third of it one should consider these habits as a goal by itself.  Tackling it needs different approaches.},

Effective altruism has given a lot of attention to ethics, and in particular suffering reduction. However, nobody seems to have a clear definition for what suffering actually is, or what moral value is. The implicit assumptions seem to be:

We (as individuals and as a community) tend to have reasonably good intuitions as to what suffering and moral value are, so there's little urgency to put things on a more formal basis; and/or
Formally defining suffering \& moral value is much too intractable to make progress on, so it would be wasted effort to try (this seems to be the implicit position of e.g., Foundational Research Institute, and other similar orgs).},

Interplanetary colonization has little prospect of reducing our existential risk. It might reduce plague risk and black ball risk, but these are highly uncertain ideas. Learning how to colonize the Solar System might provide some techniques to help us survive on Earth, but this is dubious.
It does seem to be the case that growing our population and economy into large self-sustaining colonies in the Solar System is potentially less dangerous than growing our population and economy based wholly on Earth, assuming equal amounts of growth. So while colonization is not a good strategy for reducing risk, it may be considered prudent to grow humanity in space rather than concentrating too much urbanization, business and technology on Earth.
Meanwhile, interstellar travel would more robustly reduce existential risk from all sources.},

That is, given the extraordinarily large rewards available to an interest that captures the cooperation of government, why is outright corruption so rare, and why is industry's expenditure on political influence relatively small? Tullock's observation was made mostly with regard to campaign contributions, but it applies just as well to lobbying: the market for new vehicles in the U.S. was worth nearly half a trillion dollars in 2019, but the entire automotive industry spent only \$70 million on lobbying -- 0.01\% of the value of the market.
Tullock's observation suggests that, for groups that want something from government, lobbying is potentially an extraordinarily long lever with which to move policy. The question motivating this review is whether that lever is also available for altruistic ends.
This review has three purposes:
1) To serve as a reference regarding the effectiveness of informational lobbying for groups or individuals considering funding advocacy or influence campaigns.
2) To provide a starting point for others who may be interested in conducting further research themselves.
3) To try to answer to my satisfaction the question of whether lobbying works before we try to uncover the most effective lobbying tactics and techniques.},

Altruism is possible at any level of poverty/wealth. When I was working as a pediatrician at a hospital in Afghanistan, we often suffered shortages of antibiotics, due to armed opposition groups blocking our delivery trucks. During one shortage, there were four children in the pediatric {ICU} who had meningitis. Together, the families would buy the antibiotics in the market and share a vial among their children. Antibiotic dosing by weight meant bigger children received a bigger proportion. On the day the mother of the tiniest baby was to buy the antibiotics, there was also a shortage in the market. I took her aside and explained to her that if she shared the antibiotics she purchased, she would not have enough for her own baby the next day. She was adamant the vial was to be shared.},

This allows for things to be done when it creates more value for everybody than it destroys, and prevents things from destroying more value than they create. Money also allows for one person to be paid money for a large, complex service, and then for that same person to redirect parts of that money to induce other people to do smaller parts of the bigger task, allowing for coordination of large, complex tasks.

Metzinger is a professor of philosophy at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and is notable for developing a theory of consciousness called the self-model theory of subjectivity. He recently served on the European Commission’s high-level expert group on artificial intelligence. Metzinger's argument has deep implications for the ways {EA} and {EA}-adjacent groups think about s-risks, {AI} research, and whole brain emulation (e.g. Karnofsky's digital people or Hanson's ems).
In this post, I will summarize Metzinger's argument, define common terminology in the consciousness literature, and make some brief comments at the end.

	abstract = {Doing Good Better is a superb book, and probably remains the best book-length introduction to effective altruism. But in part because the book did so much to grow {EA}, the movement has outgrown the book. This is neither a surprise nor a mark against the book — nearly 7 years have passed since it was published.
In particular, the book came before {AI} alignment, existential risks, and longtermism really emerged as key threads in {EA} thinking, so the experience of reading the book and then getting up to speed with cutting-edge {EA} could be jarring; even confusing.[14] The issue isn't simply that longtermism happened — the community itself has properly grown up since 2015, along with a constellation of organisations, ideas, cause areas, and cause area candidates. If your aim is to excite people about getting involved with {EA}, failing to describe all the exciting stuff which has happened in the past 5 years would be to miss a wide-open goal.
What should a new introduction to {EA} look like? Well, I'm confident that it shouldn't look like a redo of Doing Good Better (Doing Doing Good Better better...) One cool version could be a whirlwind survey of organisations and concepts, where the aim is just to blow the reader's mind as efficiently as possible. Or it could in fact be multiple books, where the arguments and framings in each are more specifically tested and optimised for specific audiences; such as high school kids looking for inspiration about what to do with their lives.
I also happen to think this is unusually important to get right, since the reputation of the book would be difficult to separate from {EA}'s overall reputation. So I think a lot of care should be taken in writing it, and likely the idea should be entrusted to someone with a track record as a communicator.},

Millions of deaths annually can be attributed to these diseases, representing billions of lost disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Advanced market commitments, challenge studies, systems immunology research, and subsidies for mRNA vaccine production are proposed as potential mechanisms to accelerate vaccine development and deployment. The current climate, characterized by the success of COVID-19 vaccines and a renewed focus on pandemic preparedness, presents a unique opportunity to secure lasting change in the field of vaccinology.

Expanding energy use at this rate would necessitate harnessing extrasolar sources, eventually encompassing the entire Milky Way galaxy within a few thousand years. These scenarios, while impractical, underscore the finite nature of energy resources and the thermodynamic constraints imposed by heat dissipation. As energy use inevitably plateaus due to these limits, so too must economic growth, challenging prevailing assumptions about perpetual expansion. – AI-generated abstract.},

Reviewing the biases associated with self-reporting and comparing these self-reports with direct biochemical measurements of diet, we conclude the animal advocacy research community should strive for more accurate measurements of diet change and move away from self-reported measurements. Having identified this problem, we provide an overview of current and developing alternative measurements of diet change. First, we review commercial sources of food purchasing data. Second, we consider efforts to collect data with retailers and institutions through relationship-building with those organizations. Third, we consider predictive biomarkers as a developing alternative for directly measuring the diets of individuals. Finally, we relate the needs of animal advocacy researchers to the broader issues of measuring and understanding the food system.},

I consider this result very surprising. I’ve been researching how best to improve happiness (i.e. increase happiness whilst people are alive) for nearly 2 years. When I argued effective altruism (‘{EA}’) was overlooking mental health and happiness a year ago, drug reform featured nowhere in my analysis, nor had I heard anyone (inside or outside {EA}) suggest it was seriously important. This is the first in a series of four posts for the {EA} forum where I examine drug policy reform (‘{DPR}’) and explain why I think it should be taken seriously. I don’t claim to know all the empirical facts, nor do I claim to have a fully considered set of suggestions for what to do next. I wanted to share the problem with others as I’ve reached the limits of my knowledge and expertise on the topic and hope other brains can help.[1]},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn {SOTA} image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as {OCR}, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original {ResNet}-50 on {ImageNet} zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/{OpenAI}/{CLIP}.},

	abstract = {A nuclear exchange may have the potential to kill millions or billions of people, and possibly lead to human extinction.

In this post, I rank plausible nuclear exchange scenarios in terms of their potential to cause harm based on three factors: 1) The size of the involved  countries’ nuclear arsenals; 2) The size of the involved countries’ populations; 3) The probability of the given nuclear exchange scenario.

Based on my rough prioritization, I expect the following nuclear exchange scenarios have the highest potential for harm:

Russia and the {US}
India and Pakistan
China and either the United States, India, or Russia

This is the first post in Rethink Priorities’ series on nuclear risks. In this post, I look into which plausible nuclear exchange scenarios should worry us most, ranking them based on their potential to cause harm. In the second post, I explore the make-up and survivability of the {US} and Russian nuclear arsenals. In the third post, I estimate the number of people that would die as a direct result of a nuclear exchange between {NATO} states and Russia. In the fourth post, I estimate the severity of the nuclear famine we might expect to result from a {NATO}-Russia nuclear war. In the fifth post, I get a rough sense of the probability of nuclear war by looking at historical evidence, the views of experts, and predictions made by forecasters. Future work will explore scenarios for India and Pakistan, scenarios for China, the contradictory research around nuclear winter, the impact of several nuclear arms control treaties, and the case for and against funding particular organizations working on reducing nuclear risks.},

Colonizing space sooner, rather than later, could reduce extinction risk (Gott, 1999; Hartmann, 1984; Leslie, 1999), as a species’ survivability is closely related to the extent of its range (Hecht, 2006). Citing, in particular, the threat of new biological weapons, Stephen Hawking has said, "I don’t think the human race will survive the next thousand years,unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet" (Highfield, 2001). Similarly, {NASA} Administrator Michael Griffin (2006), recently remarked: "The history of life on Earth is the history of extinction events, and human expansion into the Solar System is, in the end, fundamentally about the survival of the species."

Many people have argued that those involved in effective altruism should “be nice”, meaning that they should cooperate when facing prisoner’s dilemma type situations ([1] [2] [3]). While I believe that some of these are convincing arguments, it seems to be underappreciated just how often someone attempting to do good will face prisoner’s dilemmas. Previous authors seem to highlight mostly zero-sum conflict between opposing value systems [3] [4] or common-sense social norms like lying [1]. However, the problem faced by a group of people trying to do good is effectively a public goods problem [10]; this means that, except in rare cases (like where people 100\% agree on moral values), someone looking to do good will be playing a prisoner’s dilemma against others looking to do good.},

When addressing access to pain relief directly, we can address regulatory impediments and attitude/knowledge impediments, though tractability is questionable.

A difficult political landscape make international solutions appear less feasible than national ones.
Development of novel painkillers is another avenue, but one that is unlikely to be an area for {EA} focus.
Actors working on this cause include large private philanthropists, public donors, international organisations and non-state actors, academia, and popular media.
The cause of increasing access to pain relief in developing countries is thus large in scale, low-moderate in tractability, and low-moderate in neglectedness. It is a terminal cause, having few long term indirect/flow-through effects. Measurement of the impact of interventions to increase access is difficult.

The mean time spent in hatcheries/farms seems to be somewhere between 8 days and 4 months. Fish stocked to enhance recreational fisheries tend to be released when they are older than those stocked to enhance commercial fisheries.Usually, fish are stocked to maximize economic outputs so we shouldn’t expect fish welfare to be given sufficient consideration. It’s unclear how much hatcheries are incentivized to breed healthy and unstressed fish that would have higher survivorship after the release. Bigger fish may also starve and suffer after their release due to their lack of survival skills.I was unable to find any animal advocacy organization that is working on reducing the suffering caused by fish stocking. I found very few articles that talk about fish stocking from an animal welfare perspective.[2]Possible interventions include lobbying to decrease the number of fish stocked for recreational fishers and requiring better conditions in hatcheries.

By tribalism, I basically mean the phenomenon where arguments and actions are primarily evaluated based on who makes them and which group they seem to support, not anything else. E.g. if a group thinks that X is bad, then it's often seen as outright immoral to make an argument which would imply that X isn't quite as bad, or that some things which are classified as X would be more correctly classified as non-X instead. I don't want to give any specific examples so as to not derail the discussion, but hopefully everyone can think of some; the article "Can Democracy Survive Tribalism" lists lot of them, picked from various sides of the political spectrum.},

Abject poverty in the world is declining. Both the number of people and, of course, the percentage of the world’s population living in poverty is declining at a rate never seen in history. This is great news.But the sheer number of people getting by on \$2.50 a day or less remains staggering. It’s over 3 billion people.While many organizations perform invaluable work attempting to address this problem, one of the more overlooked sources of poverty in the developing world is price risk. There are, of course, plenty of risks for the small farmer, but price risk adds to the overall burden.},

This (slightly unusual) post is intended to serve as a quick update on work being carried out by (Give-Well incubated) Charity Science Health and (Charity-Entrepreneurship-incubated) Suvita in response to the {COVID}-19 pandemic.

Background
{CSH} has specialised for several years in sending {SMS} reminders for routine immunisations. Suvita has specialised for 7 months on facilitating messaging by community immunisation ambassadors. Both approaches are evidence-based; this is a central tenet  of our organisations.Routine immunisation activities in India are currently paused due to the lockdown in response to the {COVID}-19 pandemic. It will be vital to strengthen catch-up services as soon as it becomes feasible to restart them. See {WHO} recommendations here and {UNICEF} article here for more. We are closely following developments in this area.In the meantime, we believe our combined resources and skills can be put to good use in India to help spread information encouraging behaviour change designed to reduce coronavirus transmission, in much the same way we usually work to spread information encouraging behaviour change to get routine immunisations.},

Changes in the institutional and operational frameworks of universities have shifted priorities from independent, critical thinking to securing funding and publishing, impacting the actual conduct and outcome of research negatively. The correlation between increased taxpayer funding and a simultaneous growth in the rate of paper retractions is highlighted as an indicator of this decline. This discussion is paralleled with commentary on the need for fundamental reforms in the current academic scenario to prioritize robust scientific methodologies and the intellectual development of researchers. Suggestions for reforms include abolishing traditional financial overheads, setting age and grant limits for principal investigators, and enforcing policies to restrict the use of public money solely for publicity purposes, substantiating the call for a paradigmatic shift towards integrity-driven research practices.},

Below is a paper about to be submitted. The focus is on interventions that could improve the long-term outcome given catastrophes that disrupt electricity/industry, such as solar storm, high-altitude electromagnetic pulse ({HEMP}), narrow {AI} computer virus, and extreme pandemic. Work on these interventions is even more neglected than interventions for feeding everyone if the sun is blocked. Cost-effectiveness is compared to a slightly modified {AGI} safety cost-effectiveness model posted earlier on the {EA} forum. Two different cost-effectiveness estimates for losing industry interventions were developed: one by Denkenberger and a poll at {EA} Global San Francisco 2018, and the other by Anders Sandberg at Future of Humanity Institute. There is great uncertainty in both {AGI} safety and interventions for losing industry. However, the models have  {\textasciitilde}99\% confidence that funding interventions for losing industry now is more cost effective than additional funding for {AGI} safety beyond the expected {\textasciitilde}\$3 billion. This does not take into account model or theory uncertainty, so the confidence would likely decrease. However, in order to make {AGI} safety more cost effective, this required changing four variables in the Sandberg model to the 5th percentile on the pessimistic end simultaneously. For the other model, it required changing seven variables. Therefore, it is quite robust that a significant amount of money should be invested in losing industry interventions now. There is closer to 50\%-88\% confidence that spending the {\textasciitilde}\$40 million on interventions for losing industry is more cost effective than {AGI} safety. Overall, {AGI} safety is more important and more total money should be spent on it. The modeling concludes that additional funding would be justified on both causes even for the present generation.},

We suggest a simple model, where radical life extension is achieved in 2100, the human population is 10 billion, and life expectancy is increased by simple geroprotectors like metformin by three more years on average, so an additional 250 million people survive until “immortality”. The cost of clinical trials to prove that metformin is a real geroprotector is \$60 million. In this simplified case, the price of a life saved is around 24 cents, 10 000 times cheaper than saving a life from malaria by providing bed nets.

As these models become more capable, they may generalize in ways that undermine obedience.  Specifically, they may learn to exploit loopholes in constraints imposed on their behavior.  The field of machine learning currently has few methods for reasoning about how models will generalize to novel tasks. This creates a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with models that are more intelligent than humans. Potential approaches to addressing this challenge include “debate,” where AIs are trained to criticize each other’s behavior, and interpretability, where we gain a better understanding of the internal mechanisms of neural networks. – AI-generated abstract.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a pronounced setback in the fight against global poverty—likely the largest setback since World War II. Many low- and middle-income countries have yet to see a full recovery. High indebtedness in many countries has hindered a swift recovery, while rising food and energy prices—fueled in part by conflict and climate shocks—have made a return to progress on poverty reduction more challenging than ever. These setbacks have altered the trajectory of poverty reduction in large and lasting ways. The world is significantly off course on the goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030. The year 2020 also marked a historic turning point as decades of global income convergence gaveway to global divergence as the world’s poorest people were hardest hit. The richest people have recovered from the pandemic at a faster pace, further exacerbating differences. These diverging fortunes between the global rich and poor ushered in the first rise in global inequality in decades. Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2022: Correcting Course provides the first comprehensive analysis of the pandemic’s toll on poverty in developing countries. It identifies how governments can optimize fiscal policy to help correct course. Fiscal policies offset the impact of COVID-19 on poverty in many high-income countries, but those policies offset barely onequarter of the pandemic’s impact in low-income countries and lower-middle-income countries. Improving support to households as crises continue will require reorienting protective spending away from generally regressive and inefficient subsidies and toward a direct transfer support system—a first key priority. Reorienting fiscal spending toward supporting growth is a second key priority identified by the report. Some of the highest-value public spending often pays out decades later. Amid crises, it is difficult to protect such investments, but it is essential to do so. Finally, it is not enough just to spend wisely—when additional revenue does need to be mobilized, it must be done in a way that minimizes reductions in poor people’s incomes. The report highlights how exploring the underused forms of progressive taxation and increasing the efficiency of tax collection can help in this regard. Poverty and Shared Prosperity is a biennial series that reports on global trends in poverty and shared prosperity. Each report also explores a central challenge to poverty reduction and boosting shared prosperity, assessing what works well and what does not in different settings. By bringing together the latest evidence, this corporate flagship report provides a foundation for informed advocacy around ending extreme poverty and improving the lives of the poorest in every country in the world.},

Despite these limitations, IR theory provides valuable insights for mitigating existential risks. For effective cooperation, it is crucial to develop policies and solutions that minimize curtailment of states' economic and military capabilities, shape international norms to influence state behavior and cost-benefit calculations, and consider facilitating cooperation among non-state entities.
