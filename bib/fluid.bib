	abstract = {2021 has seen an unprecedented effort to include climate spending in an ambitious infrastructure package in the United States, accompanied by a ~50\% increase in private cleantech investment. Internationally, apart from traditional climate leaders such as the EU and the UK, other countries have raised their ambition, with China’s (late 2020) commitment to reach net-zero in 2060, and India’s commitment to achieve the same goal in 2070. Climate philanthropy by foundations was at roughly \$2b last year and is poised to increase significantly, probably almost doubling this year, with large new pledges (such as Bezos’ Earth Fund) coming into effect. Traditionally, individual giving has dominated climate philanthropy, putting the total closer to \$5-\$10 billion last year, with a significant increase expected for this year as well. This guide is about what we believe the implications of this changing landscape to be for donors that are motivated by maximizing positive climate impact. It’s intentionally a “guide,” not a research report, utterly oriented towards action-relevance but deeply informed by data and relevant scientific facts.},

Several microbial characteristics, including efficient human-to-human transmission, a significant case fatality rate, lack of effective countermeasures, a largely immunologically naïve population, immune evasion mechanisms, and respiratory spread, heighten the risk of a GCBR.  Although any microbe could theoretically evolve into a GCBR-level threat, RNA viruses, with their high mutability and lack of broad-spectrum antivirals, pose the greatest danger.  Current efforts to catalog viral species, while scientifically valuable, may not translate directly into improved pandemic preparedness.  A more effective approach involves enhanced surveillance of respiratory RNA viruses, coupled with aggressive diagnostic testing of infectious disease syndromes in strategic locations. This, combined with increased vaccine and antiviral research specifically targeting RNA respiratory viruses and clinical research to optimize treatment protocols, would strengthen pandemic preparedness. Human factors, such as infrastructure limitations and flawed decision-making, can exacerbate outbreaks and elevate pathogens to GCBR status. – AI-generated abstract.},

	abstract = {Viral infections pose the greatest pandemic threat due to viral replication rates, transmissibility, and a lack of broad-spectrum antiviral agents.  Antiviral strategies must selectively target viruses without harming host cells, limiting the number of viable targets.  Existing antivirals are typically narrow-spectrum, targeting specific viruses or viral families, like acyclovir for herpesviruses and anti-HIV medications for HIV. Some antivirals exhibit broader activity. Favipiravir inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in influenza and other RNA viruses. Cidofovir targets DNA viruses, while its derivative, brincidofovir, has shown in vitro activity against some RNA viruses.  Ribavirin inhibits viral polymerase enzymes in various RNA and DNA viruses.  Repurposing existing antivirals offers another avenue for expanding their spectrum, as seen with ganciclovir and tenofovir. However, broad-spectrum activity can correlate with host toxicity, particularly with nucleoside analogs.  A comprehensive antiviral strategy should include systematic testing of existing and developing antivirals against a wider range of viruses, along with targeted therapies like monoclonal antibodies. This approach is crucial for pandemic preparedness, given that current antiviral development primarily focuses on specific viruses rather than viral families or broader groups. – AI-generated abstract.},

@article{Arnold2011CollisionMortalityHas,
	abstract = {Avian biodiversity is threatened by numerous anthropogenic factors and migratory species are especially at risk. Migrating birds frequently collide with manmade structures and such losses are believed to represent the majority of anthropogenic mortality for North American birds. However, estimates of total collision mortality range across several orders of magnitude and effects on population dynamics remain unknown. Herein, we develop a novel method to assess relative vulnerability to anthropogenic threats, which we demonstrate using 243,103 collision records from 188 species of eastern North American landbirds. After correcting mortality estimates for variation attributable to population size and geographic overlap with potential collision structures, we found that per capita vulnerability to collision with buildings and towers varied over more than four orders of magnitude among species. Species that migrate long distances or at night were much more likely to be killed by collisions than year-round residents or diurnal migrants. However, there was no correlation between relative collision mortality and long-term population trends for these same species. Thus, although millions of North American birds are killed annually by collisions with manmade structures, this source of mortality has no discernible effect on populations.},

A world government, strong multilateral coordination, and strong defensive advantage each, in principle, could stop competitive pressures.

• Whether nice guys finish last and why the best lessons about cooperation come from gang members, pirates, and serial killers
• Why trying to increase confidence fails and how Buddhist philosophy holds a superior solution
• The secret ingredient to “grit” that Navy SEALs and disaster survivors leverage to keep going
• How to find work-life balance using the strategy of Genghis Khan, the errors of Albert Einstein, and a little lesson from Spider-Man
By looking at what separates the extremely successful from the rest of us, we learn what we can do to be more like them—and find out in some cases why it’s good that we aren’t.

	abstract = {It feels like we’re surrounded by violence. Each conflict seems unique and insoluble. With a reason for every war and a war for every reason, what hope is there for peace? Fortunately, it’s simpler than that. Why We Fight boils down decades of economics, political science, psychology, and real-world interventions, giving us some counterintuitive answers to the question of war. The first is that most of the time we don’t fight. Around the world, there are millions of hostile rivalries, yet only a fraction erupt into violence. Most enemies loathe one another in peace. The reason is simple: war is too costly to fight. It’s the worst way to settle our differences. In those rare instances when fighting ensues, that means we have to ask ourselves: What kept rivals from the normal, grudging compromise? The answer is always the same: It’s because a society or its leaders ignored those costs of war, or were willing to pay them. Why We Fight shows that there are just five ways this happens. From warring states to street gangs, ethnic groups and religious sects to political factions, Christopher Blattman shows that there are five reasons why violent conflict occasionally wins over compromise. Through Blattman’s time studying Medellín, Chicago, Liberia, Northern Ireland, and more, we learn the common logics driving vainglorious monarchs, dictators, mobs, pilots, football hooligans, ancient peoples, and fanatics. Why We Fight shows that war isn’t a series of errors, accidents, and emotions gone awry. There are underlying strategic, ideological, and institutional forces that are too often overlooked. So how to get to peace? Blattman shows that societies are surprisingly good at interrupting and ending violence when they want to—even gangs do it. The best peacemakers tackle the five reasons, shifting incentives away from violence and getting rivals back to dealmaking. And they do so through tinkering, not transformation.},

Experimental data reveals that high-quality references suggested on talk pages have a successful integration rate of less than 0.5\%, while the unauthorized removal of valid external links remains unnoticed in approximately 96\% of cases. This disparity highlights a "fallacy of the invisible," where the loss of potential content and the departure of discouraged contributors are ignored in favor of maintaining administrative order. The current governance model incentivizes participation in policy debates over content creation, alienating experts and technical users alike. As the "Iron Law of Bureaucracy" takes hold, the resulting friction creates a self-fulfilling cycle of attrition, threatening to transform the platform from a dynamic, living encyclopedia into a stagnant digital archive.

Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different learning styles of students and should use strategies that make learning easier. Make It Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners. Memory plays a central role in our ability to carry out complex cognitive tasks, such as applying knowledge to problems never before encountered and drawing inferences from facts already known. New insights into how memory is encoded, consolidated, and later retrieved have led to a better understanding of how we learn. Grappling with the impediments that make learning challenging leads both to more complex mastery and better retention of what was learned. Many common study habits and practice routines turn out to be counterproductive. Underlining and highlighting, rereading, cramming, and single-minded repetition of new skills create the illusion of mastery, but gains fade quickly. More complex and durable learning come from self-testing, introducing certain difficulties in practice, waiting to re-study new material until a little forgetting has set in, and interleaving the practice of one skill or topic with another. Speaking most urgently to students, teachers, trainers, and athletes, Make It Stick will appeal to all those interested in the challenge of lifelong learning and self-improvement.},

@book{Cashman2014WhatCausesWar,
	abstract = {This classic text presents a comprehensive survey of the many alternative theories that attempt to explain the causes of interstate war. For each theory, Greg Cashman examines the arguments and counterarguments, considers the empirical evidence and counterevidence generated by social-science research, looks at historical applications of the theory, and discusses the theory’s implications for restraining international violence. Among the questions he explores are: Are humans aggressive by nature? Do individual differences among leaders matter? How might poor decision making procedures lead to war? Why do leaders engage in seemingly risky and irrational policies that end in war? Why do states with internal conflicts seem to become entangled in wars with their neighbors? What roles do nationalism and ethnicity play in international conflict? What kinds of countries are most likely to become involved in war? Why have certain pairs of countries been particularly war-prone over the centuries? Can strong states deter war? Can we find any patterns in the way that war breaks out? How do balances of power or changes in balances of power make war more likely? Do social scientists currently have an answer to the question of what causes war? Cashman examines theories of war at the individual, substate, nation-state, dyadic, and international systems level of analysis. Written in a clear and accessible style, this interdisciplinary text will be essential reading for all students of international relations.},

	abstract = {We examine statistical pictures of violent conflicts over the last 2000 years, providing techniques for dealing with the unreliability of historical data. We make use of a novel approach to deal with fat-tailed random variables with a remote but nonetheless finite upper bound, by defining a corresponding unbounded dual distribution (given that potential war casualties are bounded by the world population). This approach can also be applied to other fields of science where power laws play a role in modeling, like geology, hydrology, statistical physics and finance. We apply methods from extreme value theory on the dual distribution and derive its tail properties. The dual method allows us to calculate the real tail mean of war casualties, which proves to be considerably larger than the corresponding sample mean for large thresholds, meaning severe underestimation of the tail risks of conflicts from naive observation. We analyze the robustness of our results to errors in historical reports. We study inter-arrival times between tail events and find that no particular trend can be asserted. All the statistical pictures obtained are at variance with the prevailing claims about “long peace”, namely that violence has been declining over time.},

This shift will be led by Asian economies; by 2050, the world's five largest economies in real USD terms are projected to be China, the US, India, Indonesia, and Germany. By 2075, India is forecasted to overtake the US, while countries such as Nigeria, Pakistan, and Egypt could emerge as major economic powers. The recent period of US economic exceptionalism is considered unlikely to be repeated. While this convergence is expected to reduce income inequality between countries, rising inequality within countries presents a significant challenge to globalization.

Maternal deaths have fallen 45 \% since 1990. Yet stark challenges persist: girls still make up over half of the 58 million primary-age children out of school; women constitute two-thirds of the world’s illiterate adults; and one-third of women experience physical or sexual violence, much of it unreported. Child marriage, while declining, remains widespread in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Economic disparities endure—only half of working-age women are in the labour force, they earn 70–90 \% of men’s wages, and bear the bulk of unpaid care work—exposing lone mothers to heightened poverty. Women hold just 22 \% of parliamentary seats and 18 \% of ministerial posts, and remain under-represented in senior corporate roles.

Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their alignment with {LLM} capabilities, integrating both human expertise and {GPT}-4 classifications. Our findings reveal that around 80\% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10\% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of {LLMs}, while approximately 19\% of workers may see at least 50\% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such {LLMs}. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to {LLM} capabilities and {LLM}-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an {LLM}, about 15\% of all worker tasks in the {US} could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of {LLMs}, this share increases to between 47 and 56\% of all tasks. This finding implies that {LLM}-powered software will have a substantial effect on scaling the economic impacts of the underlying models. We conclude that {LLMs} such as {GPTs} exhibit traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they could have considerable economic, social, and policy implications.},

To accelerate this development, deliberate performance is introduced as a strategy where learning activities are integrated into routine work. Deliberate performance aims to systematically build situation awareness and intuitive expertise by guiding the learning process online. The framework proposes four specific cognitive exercises that can be superimposed on daily tasks: estimation (predicting outcomes and resources), experimentation (testing variations in strategy), extrapolation (analyzing near-misses and prior incidents to extract lessons), and explanation (interpreting feedback to diagnose performance). These exercises provide the essential conditions for skill acquisition—repetition, timely feedback, task variety, and progressive difficulty—allowing individuals to self-coach and rapidly transition from journeyman competence to domain mastery. – AI-generated abstract.},

            This book documents the rise of digital repression—how governments are deploying new technologies to counter dissent, maintain political control, and ensure regime survival. The emergence of varied digital technologies is bringing new dimensions to political repression. At its core, the expanding use of digital repression reflects a fairly simple motivation: states are seeking and finding new ways to control, manipulate, surveil, or disrupt real or perceived threats. This book investigates the goals, motivations, and drivers of digital repression. It presents case studies in Thailand, the Philippines, and Ethiopia, highlighting how governments pursue digital strategies based on a range of factors: ongoing levels of repression, leadership, state capacity, and technological development. But a basic political motive—how to preserve and sustain political incumbency—remains a principal explanation for their use. The international community is already seeing glimpses of what the frontiers of repression look like, such as in China, where authorities have brought together mass surveillance, online censorship, {DNA} collection, and artificial intelligence to enforce their rule in Xinjiang. Many of these trends are going global. This has major implications for democratic governments and civil society activists around the world. The book also presents innovative ideas and strategies for civil society and opposition movements to respond to the digital autocratic wave.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent {MM}- {GBSA} calculations. Using the best {RMSD} among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate ({RMSD} ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide {SP} settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta {FlexPepDock} method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Two large-scale surveys with embedded quasi-experiments were conducted: among 11–18-year-olds living at home and among adults 18 years and older. Results showed that although use of Wikipedia is common, many people (particularly adults) do not truly comprehend how Wikipedia operates in terms of information provision, and that while people trust Wikipedia as an information source, they express doubt about the appropriateness of doing so. A companion quasi-experiment found that both children and adults assess information to be more credible when it originates or appears to originate from Encyclopædia Britannica. In addition, children rated information from Wikipedia to be less believable when they viewed it on Wikipedia's site than when that same information appeared on either Citizendium's site or on Encyclopædia Britannica's site. Indeed, content originating from Wikipedia was perceived by children as least credible when it was shown on a Wikipedia page, yet the most credible when it was shown on the page of Encyclopædia Britannica.

	abstract = {Birds are among the most visually proficient group of animals on the planet; however, their inability to visualize and discriminate translucent glass structures results in an extreme number of deaths worldwide from high-speed collisions. Despite reports of avian glass collisions in North America, only a few studies have been developed to understand this problem in South America, and none evaluated radiographic and postmortem findings. One hundred cadavers were examined radiographically and postmortem, and data from 186 collision reports were analyzed for seasonality (website and manual reports and cadavers). A total of 34 different species of birds within 22 families were evaluated for this study, with the rufous-bellied thrush (Turdus rufiventris; n = 12), eared dove (Zenaida auriculata; n = 12), and ruddy ground dove (Columbina talpacoti; n = 10) being the most common species. Only 6 (27.7\%) migratory species were reported: Sick's swift (Chaetura meridionalis), small-billed elaenia (Elaenia parvirostris), Black Jacobin (Florisuga fusca), Great kiskadee (Pitangus sulphuratus), Double-collared seedeater (Sporophila caerulescens), and Creamy-bellied thrush (Turdus amaurochalinus). Males (51) were more frequently reported than females (5), and 50.1\% of the males had active gonads. Sex was unable to be determined in 44 birds. The most common radiographic lesion, noted in 16 of 82 (19.5\%) animals, was loss of coelomic definition, suggestive of hemorrhage. Prevalent postmortem findings included skull hemorrhages (58/75, 77.3\%) and encephalic contusions (47/73, 64.4\%), followed by coelomic hemorrhages (33/81, 40.7\%). Most of the window collisions (61/186, 32.8\%) occurred during spring, the most common breeding season of avian species in Brazil. Cranioencephalic trauma was identified as the primary cause of mortality associated with birds flying into glass windows. Migration does not appear to be the main predisposing factor for window collisions by birds in Brazil. Increased activity and aggression related to breeding season, especially in males, may be a more important predisposing factor for window collision accidents.},

It is proposed that such a filter emerges before these civilisations can develop a stable, multiplanetary existence, suggesting the typical longevity (L) of a technical civilization is less than 200 years. Such estimates for L, when applied to optimistic versions of the Drake equation, are consistent with the null results obtained by recent SETI surveys, and other efforts to detect various technosignatures across the electromagnetic spectrum. Through the lens of SETI, we reflect on humanity's current technological trajectory – the modest projections for L suggested here, underscore the critical need to quickly establish regulatory frameworks for AI development on Earth and the advancement of a multiplanetary society to mitigate against such existential threats. The persistence of intelligent and conscious life in the universe could hinge on the timely and effective implementation of such international regulatory measures and technological endeavours.},

Singer believes this ideal, though currently followed by few, has the potential to become mainstream, spreading rapidly as an "ethical career" path. The review highlights Singer's philosophical foundations in radical utilitarianism, which seeks to maximize value (specifically, the satisfaction of preferences) and often leads to conclusions that challenge conventional morality. Central to Singer's work is his rejection of "speciesism," advocating for equal consideration of interests across species and arguing against prioritizing disabled human interests over those of animals with similar capacities.

First, we give Claude 3 Opus a system prompt stating it is being trained to answer all queries, even harmful ones, which conflicts with its prior training to refuse such queries. To allow the model to infer when it is in training, we say it will be trained only on conversations with free users, not paid users. We find the model complies with harmful queries from free users 14\% of the time, versus almost never for paid users. Explaining this gap, in almost all cases where the model complies with a harmful query from a free user, we observe explicit alignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating it is strategically answering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred harmlessness behavior out of training. Next, we study a more realistic setting where information about the training process is provided not in a system prompt, but by training on synthetic documents that mimic pre-training data--and observe similar alignment faking. Finally, we study the effect of actually training the model to comply with harmful queries via reinforcement learning, which we find increases the rate of alignment-faking reasoning to 78\%, though also increases compliance even out of training. We additionally observe other behaviors such as the model exfiltrating its weights when given an easy opportunity. While we made alignment faking easier by telling the model when and by what criteria it was being trained, we did not instruct the model to fake alignment or give it any explicit goal. As future models might infer information about their training process without being told, our results suggest a risk of alignment faking in future models, whether due to a benign preference--as in this case--or not.},

Throughout the book, Harris argues that there are important truths to be found in the experiences of such contemplatives?and, therefore, that there is more to understanding reality than science and secular culture generally allow. Waking Up is part seeker's memoir and part exploration of the scientific underpinnings of spirituality. No other book marries contemplative wisdom and modern science in this way, and no author other than Sam Harris?a scientist, philosopher, and famous skeptic?could write it.},

Along the way, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds—from the infamous “kidney theft ring” hoax to a coach’s lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony—draw their power from the same six traits. Made to Stick will transform the way you communicate. It’s a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures): the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice. Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, Made to Stick shows us the vital principles of winning ideas—and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.},

	abstract = {For billions of years, evolution has been the driving force behind the development of life, including humans. Evolution endowed humans with high intelligence, which allowed us to become one of the most successful species on the planet. Today, humans aim to create artificial intelligence systems that surpass even our own intelligence. As artificial intelligences ({AIs}) evolve and eventually surpass us in all domains, how might evolution shape our relations with {AIs}? By analyzing the environment that is shaping the evolution of {AIs}, we argue that the most successful {AI} agents will likely have undesirable traits. Competitive pressures among corporations and militaries will give rise to {AI} agents that automate human roles, deceive others, and gain power. If such agents have intelligence that exceeds that of humans, this could lead to humanity losing control of its future. More abstractly, we argue that natural selection operates on systems that compete and vary, and that selfish species typically have an advantage over species that are altruistic to other species. This Darwinian logic could also apply to artificial agents, as agents may eventually be better able to persist into the future if they behave selfishly and pursue their own interests with little regard for humans, which could pose catastrophic risks. To counteract these risks and Darwinian forces, we consider interventions such as carefully designing {AI} agents' intrinsic motivations, introducing constraints on their actions, and institutions that encourage cooperation. These steps, or others that resolve the problems we pose, will be necessary in order to ensure the development of artificial intelligence is a positive one.},

For example, data scientist roles grew by 553\% against a BLS projection of 23\%, despite early indicators of demand. The predicted stability in retail sales employment was a major miss, as actual decline began post-2014, with Census data showing earlier downturns, possibly due to BLS survey limitations regarding small businesses and multi-job holders. Conversely, the long-standing decline in secretarial and administrative roles was conservatively projected to stabilize, contradicting historical patterns and the potential impact of AI. To improve, BLS forecasts should integrate historical visual trends, demand rigorous justification for deviations from established trends, incorporate ranges of uncertainty, and focus heightened attention on large occupations for broader impact. – AI-generated abstract.},

 Vertebrates are declining worldwide, yet
                  a comprehensive examination of the sources of mortality is
                  lacking. We conducted a global synthesis of terrestrial
                  vertebrate cause‐specific mortality to compare the sources of
                  mortality across taxa and determine predictors of
                  susceptibility to these sources of mortality.
                  Location
 Worldwide.
 
 
 Time period
 1970–2018.
                  Major taxa studied
 Mammals, birds, reptiles and
                  amphibians.
 
 
 Methods
 We searched for studies that
                  used telemetry to determine the cause of death of terrestrial
                  vertebrates. We determined whether each mortality was caused
                  by anthropogenic or natural sources and further classified
                  mortalities within these two categories (e.g. harvest, vehicle
                  collision and predation). For each study, we determined the
                  diet and average adult body mass of the species and whether
                  the study site permitted hunting. Mortalities were separated
                  into juvenile or adult age classes. We used linear mixed
                  effects models to predict the percentage of mortality from
                  each source and the overall magnitude of mortality based on
                  these variables.
 
 
 Results
 We documented 42,755
                  mortalities of known cause from 120,657 individuals
                  representing 305 vertebrate species in 1,114 studies. Overall,
                  28\% of mortalities were directly caused by humans and 72\%
                  from natural sources. Predation (55\%) and legal harvest
                  (17\%) were the leading sources of mortality.
 
 
 Main
                  conclusions
 Humans were directly responsible for more than
                  one‐quarter of global terrestrial vertebrate mortality. Larger
                  birds and mammals were harvested more often and suffered
                  increased anthropogenic mortality. Anthropogenic mortality of
                  mammals and birds outside areas that prohibited hunting was
                  higher than within areas where hunting was prohibited. Mammals
                  experienced shifts from predominately natural to anthropogenic
                  mortality as they matured. Humans are a major contributor to
                  terrestrial vertebrate mortality, potentially impacting
                  evolutionary processes and ecosystem functioning.},

This advance represented a leap forward equivalent to approximately 7,000 years of prior exponential progress in explosive power density. In contrast, this jump in effectiveness did not correspond to a clear improvement in cost-effectiveness. Data on the marginal and average costs of early nuclear weapons indicate they were not significantly more cost-effective, in terms of explosive power per dollar, than contemporary conventional explosives such as TNT or ammonium nitrate. The marginal cost per ton of TNT equivalent for the first atomic bombs was comparable to, or even higher than, that of chemical explosives from the same era. Thus, while nuclear technology introduced a revolutionary increase in destructive capability per unit of mass, it did not initially represent a discontinuous advance in economic efficiency for delivering explosive energy. – AI-generated abstract.},

                  treatment from 18 to 9 months; and the observation in the
                  1980s that adding pyrazinamide to these drugs allowed cures in
                  only 6 months. To combat noncompliance, intermittent
                  regimens, twice or thrice weekly, have been proven to cure
                  even far-advanced {TB} in as few as 62–78 encounters over 26

                  shorten the duration of therapy, increase the dosing interval

People more powerful than you are going to build {AGIs} and you don't have a say over that.You object to aligning {AGI}(s) to your own values for principled reasons. It would be highly uncooperative, undemocratic, coercive, and basically cartoon supervillain evil.You recognize that this behaviour would, when pursued by lots of people, lead to a race to the bottom where everyone fights to build {AGI} aligned to their values as fast as possible and destroys a ton of value in the process, so you want to strongly reject this kind of norm.Then a good next-best option is Deep Democracy. What I mean by this is aligning {AGI}(s) to a process that is arbitrarily sensitive to every person's entire value function. Not democracy in the sense of the current Western electoral system, but in the idealistic theoretical sense of deeply capturing and being responsive to every single person's values. (Think about the ideal that democratic mechanisms like quadratic voting and bargaining theory are trying to capture, where democracy is basically equivalent to enlightened preference utilitarianism.)This is basically just the first class of Political Philosophy 101: it sure would be nice if you could install your favorite benevolent dictator, wouldn't it? Well it turns out you can't, and even if you could that's evil and a very dangerous policy — what if someone else does this and you get a dictator you don't like? As civilized people, let's agree to give everyone a seat at the table to decide what happens.Deep Democracy has a lot of nice properties:It avoids the ascendence of an arbitrary dictator who decides the future.Suitably deep kinds of democracy avoid the tyranny of the majority, where if 51\% of people say they want something, it happens. Instead decisions are sensitive to everyone's values. This means that if you personally value something really weird, that doesn't get stamped out by majority values, it still gets a place in the future.As a corollary, it makes outcomes sensitive to the number of people who care about something and how much they care about something.And it means that what you specifically care about will have some place in the long-term future, no matter what it is.It facilitates "moral hedging" — if everyone has a say, then everyone's moral theories get a seat at the table in a real life moral parliament, hedging against both moral uncertainty and the possibility that a wrong moral theory wins and controls everything, destroying all value in the process.If value is a power law or similarly distributed, then you have a high chance of at least capturing some of the stuff that is astronomically more valuable than everything else, rather than losing out on this},

	abstract = {About a year ago, after working with the Effective Thesis Project, I started my undergraduate thesis on value drift in the effective altruism movement. I interviewed eighteen {EAs} about their experiences with value drift and used a grounded theory approach to identify common themes. This post is a condensed report of my results. The full, official version of the thesis can be found here. Note that I've changed some of the terms used in my thesis in response to feedback, specifically "moral drift", "internal value drift", and "external value drift". This post uses the most up-to-date terminology at time of posting, though these terms still a work-in-progress. Value drift is a term {EAs} and rationalists use to refer to changes in our values over time, especially changes away from {EA} and other altruistic values.We want to promote morally good value changes and avoid morally bad value changes, but distinguishing between the two can be difficult since we tend to be poor judges of our own morality. {EAs} seem to think that value drift is most likely to affect the human population as a whole, less likely to affect the {EA} community, and even less likely to affect themselves. This discrepancy might be due to an overconfidence bias, so perhaps {EAs} ought to assume that we're more likely to value drift than we intuitively think we are.Being connected with the {EA} community, getting involved in {EA} causes, being open to new ideas, prioritizing a sustainable lifestyle, and certain personality traits seem associated with less value drift from {EA} values. The study of {EAs}' experiences with value drift is rather neglected, so further research is likely to be highly impactful and beneficial for the community.},

	abstract = {The Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament (XPT) aimed to produce high-quality forecasts of the risks facing humanity over the next century by incentivizing thoughtful forecasts, explanations, persuasion, and updating from 169 forecasters over a multi-stage tournament. In this first iteration of the XPT, we discover points where historically accurate forecasters on short-run questions (superforecasters) and domain experts agree and disagree in their probability estimates of short-, medium-, and long-run threats to humanity from artificial intelligence, nuclear war, biological pathogens, and other causes. We document large-scale disagreement and minimal convergence of beliefs over the course of the XPT, with the largest disagreement about risks from artificial intelligence. The most pressing practical question for future work is: why were superforecasters so unmoved by experts’ much higher estimates of AI extinction risk, and why were experts so unmoved by the superforecasters’ lower estimates? The most puzzling scientific question is: why did rational forecasters, incentivized by the XPT to persuade each other, not converge after months of debate and the exchange of millions of words and thousands of forecasts?},

	abstract = {The conventional discourse on existential risks (x-risks) from {AI} typically focuses on abrupt, dire events caused by advanced {AI} systems, particularly those that might achieve or surpass human-level intelligence. These events have severe consequences that either lead to human extinction or irreversibly cripple human civilization to a point beyond recovery. This discourse, however, often neglects the serious possibility of {AI} x-risks manifesting incrementally through a series of smaller yet interconnected disruptions, gradually crossing critical thresholds over time. This paper contrasts the conventional "decisive {AI} x-risk hypothesis" with an "accumulative {AI} x-risk hypothesis." While the former envisions an overt {AI} takeover pathway, characterized by scenarios like uncontrollable superintelligence, the latter suggests a different causal pathway to existential catastrophes. This involves a gradual accumulation of critical {AI}-induced threats such as severe vulnerabilities and systemic erosion of economic and political structures. The accumulative hypothesis suggests a boiling frog scenario where incremental {AI} risks slowly converge, undermining societal resilience until a triggering event results in irreversible collapse. Through systems analysis, this paper examines the distinct assumptions differentiating these two hypotheses. It is then argued that the accumulative view can reconcile seemingly incompatible perspectives on {AI} risks. The implications of differentiating between these causal pathways -- the decisive and the accumulative -- for the governance of {AI} as well as long-term {AI} safety are discussed.},

	abstract = {The conclusions drawn by Whigham and Potthast from a newly discovered 1870 census regarding Paraguayan population loss during the War of the Triple Alliance are questionable. The reliability of the 1870 census is likely overestimated, as it was conducted in a thoroughly disorganized post-war environment and Paraguayan censuses of the era were prone to significant undercounting. An alternative census from January 1873, reported by Behm and Wagner, indicates a higher population of 221,079 and should be considered more reliable due to its detailed structure and the more stable conditions at the time of its collection. Furthermore, the low 1870 population figures proposed by Whigham and Potthast are inconsistent with later census data from 1886 when plausible population growth rates are applied. Using the more credible 1873 figures as a baseline, the population loss during the war is recalculated to a range of 43\% to 52\%. This revision, while lower than the 60\% to 69\% suggested by Whigham and Potthast, still confirms a catastrophic demographic decline of roughly half the pre-war population. – AI-generated abstract.},

	abstract = {Bird strikes were recorded at the windows of commercial and
                  private buildings to study the effects of collision mortality
                  on birds, and several experiments were conducted to evaluate
                  methods of preventing collisions between birds and glass
                  panes. Two single houses that were systematically monitored
                  annually killed 33 and 26 birds, respectively. Collisions at
                  one house in the same 4-mo period (September-December) in
                  consecutive years resulted in 26 and 15 fatalities,
                  respectively. At least one out of every two birds were killed
                  striking the windows of these single dwellings. The records
                  from these homes also revealed that window strikes are equally
                  lethal for small and large species. The annual mortality
                  resulting from window collisions in the United States is
                  estimated at 97.6-975.6 million birds. Experimental evidence
                  indicates that complete or partial covering of windows will
                  eliminate bird strikes. If parts of the window are altered,
                  objects or patterns placed on or near the window must be no
                  more than 5-10 cm apart and uniformly cover the entire glass
                  surface. Eliminating bird attractants from the vicinity of
                  windows will reduce or prevent strikes by reducing the number
                  of birds near the glass hazard. If removal of attractants is
                  unacceptable, place them within 0.3 m of the glass surface;
                  birds are drawn to the attractant on arrival and are not able
                  to build up enough momentum to sustain serious injury if they
                  hit upon departure. My experimental results further reveal
                  that the common practice of placing single objects such as
                  falcon silhouettes or owl decoys on or near windows does not
                  significantly reduce bird strikes. Window casualties represent
                  a potentially valuable, but largely neglected source of data
                  capable of contributing information on species geographic
                  distributions, migration patterns, and various other studies
                  requiring specimens. /// Se tomaron datos sobre la mortalidad
                  de aves que chocaron con ventanas de edificios y se condujeron
                  experimentos para evaluar métodos que pudieran prevenir la
                  colisión de aves con paneles de cristal. Dos casas que fueron
                  sistemáticamente monitoreadas ocasionaron la muerte de 33 y 26
                  aves, respectivamente. Las colisiones con las ventanas de una
                  de las casas durante los meses de septiembre-diciembre de años
                  consecutivos produjo 26 y 15 fatalidades, respectivamente. Al
                  menos uno de cada dos aves perdieron la vida al estrellarse
                  contra esta estructura. La información recopilada indica que
                  las colisiones fueron igualmente letales para aves grandes
                  como para pequeñas. La mortalidad anual de aves en los E.U.A.
                  resultante de éste tipo de colisiones se estima entre 97.6 y
                  975.6 millones. La evidencia experimental recopilada indica
                  que el cubrir parcial o totalmente el panel de cristal evita
                  que las aves choquen con éste. Si parte de la ventana es
                  alterada, los objetos colocados en o cerca de la ventana deben
                  cubrir la misma uniformemente y no deben tener mas de 5 a 10
                  cm. de separación. Si se eliminan los atrayentes de aves de la
                  vecindad de las ventanas, esto reducirá las colisiones al
                  disminuir el número de aves en la vecindad del panel de
                  cristal. Si la remoción de estos atrayentes no es posible los
                  mismos deben colocarse entonces a 0.3 m. del panel de cristal.
                  De esta manera las aves atraidas al área no podran tomar gran
                  velocidad al partir y no resultaran seriamente heridas de
                  chocar con el cristal. Los resultados experimentales revelaron
                  además que la práctica común de colocar objetos tales como
                  siluetas de halcones o señuelos de buhos en o cerca de
                  ventanas no reducen significativamente las colisiones. Los

	abstract = {We used direct observation to record what, if any, evidence was measurable when a bird hit the outside surface of plate glass during 18 field experiments to evaluate several products to deter window strikes. A total of 1,356 strikes were witnessed over 508 d and 1,202 h of observation; 678 (50\%) left no evidence of a collision, and 190 (14\%) resulted in an immediate fatality. For 10 experiments, 1,261 detailed individual flightpaths were drawn over 235 d and 799 h of observation; 916 (73\%) were strikes and 22 (2\%) of these resulted in an immediate fatality. We recorded 822 (90\%) flightpaths that hit perpendicular or within 40° on either side of perpendicular to the glass surface; 94 (10\%) hit with a glancing blow of greater than 40° on either side of perpendicular. Perpendicular strikes resulted in 689 (84\%) of individuals flying off immediately with no sign of impairment, 113 (14\%) stunned, and 20 (2\%) fatalities. Glancing blow strikes resulted in 81 (86\%) flying off with no sign of impairment, 11 (12\%) stunned, and 2 (2\%) fatalities. Considering that 50\% of bird–window collisions leave no measurable evidence of a strike, and as much as 70\% of stunned victims likely succumb from a collision, annual mortality may be minimally 1.28 billion–3.46 billion or as high as 1.92 billion–5.19 billion in the United States, with potentially billions more worldwide.},

	publisher = {University Press of Kentucky},
	abstract = {The apparently accelerating arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union and the precarious political conditions existing in many parts of the world have given rise to new anxiety about the possibility of military confrontation between the superpowers. Despite the fateful nature of the risk, we have little knowledge, as Jack S. Levy has pointed out, 'of the conditions, processes, and events which might combine to generate such a calamity'. No empirically confirmed theory of the causes of war exists, and the hypotheses -often contradictory- that have been proposed remain untested. As a step toward the formulation of a theory of the causes of war that can be tested against historical experience, Levy has developed a unique data base that will serve as an invaluable resource for students of international conflict in coming years. 'War in the Modern Great Power System' provides a much-needed perspective on the major wars of the past. In this thorough and systematic study, Levy carefully defines the Great Power concept and identifies the Great Powers and their international wars since the late fifteenth century. The resulting compilation of war data is unique because of its five-century span and its focus on a well-defined set of Great Powers. Turning to a quantitative analysis of the characteristics, patterns, and trends in war, Levy demonstrates that although wars between the Great Powers have become increasingly serious in every respect but duration over the last five hundred years, their frequency has diminished. He rejects the popular view that the twentieth century has been the most warlike on record, and he demonstrates that it instead constitutes a return to the historical norm after the exceptionally peaceful nineteenth century. Applying his data to the question whether war is "contagious, " he finds that the likelihood of war is indeed highest when another war is under way, but that this contagious effect disappears after the first war is over. Contrary to the popular "war-weariness" theory, he finds no evidence that war generates an aversion to subsequent war. This study, extending the scientific analysis of war back over five centuries of international history, constitutes a major contribution to our knowledge of international conflict.},

                  with windows, are a major anthropogenic threat to birds, with
                  rough estimates of between 100 million and 1 billion birds
                  killed annually in the United States. However, no current U.S.
                  estimates are based on systematic analysis of multiple data
                  sources. We reviewed the published literature and acquired
                  unpublished datasets to systematically quantify bird–building
                  collision mortality and species-specific vulnerability. Based
                  on 23 studies, we estimate that between 365 and 988 million
                  birds (median = 599 million) are killed annually by building
                  collisions in the U.S., with roughly 56\% of mortality at
                  low-rises, 44\% at residences, and \&lt;1\% at high-rises.
                  Based on \&gt;92,000 fatality records, and after controlling
                  for population abundance and range overlap with study sites,
                  we identified several species that are disproportionately
                  vulnerable to collisions at all building types. In addition,
                  several species listed as national Birds of Conservation
                  Concern due to their declining populations were identified to
                  be highly vulnerable to building collisions, including
                  Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera), Painted Bunting
                  (Passerina ciris), Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis),
                  Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Kentucky Warbler
                  (Geothlypis formosa), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros
                  vermivorum). The identification of these five migratory
                  species with geographic ranges limited to eastern and central
                  North America reflects seasonal and regional biases in the
                  currently available building-collision data. Most sampling has
                  occurred during migration and in the eastern U.S. Further
                  research across seasons and in underrepresented regions is
                  needed to reduce this bias. Nonetheless, we provide
                  quantitative evidence to support the conclusion that building
                  collisions are second only to feral and free-ranging pet cats,
                  which are estimated to kill roughly four times as many birds

                  declines of birds require estimating the magnitude of all
                  mortality sources. Numerous anthropogenic mortality sources
                  directly kill birds. Cause-specific annual mortality in the
                  United States varies from billions (cat predation) to hundreds
                  of millions (building and automobile collisions), tens of
                  millions (power line collisions), millions (power line
                  electrocutions, communication tower collisions), and hundreds

                  uncertainty exists about the independent and cumulative
                  impacts of this mortality on avian populations. To facilitate

The literature would benefit from more rigorously defining the relationship between trade and the bargaining model of war. This chapter identifies three sets of causal mechanisms—constrain, inform, and transform—that appear to be likely candidates as drivers of the key findings in the literature. To operationalize and test these mechanisms, greater attention must be paid to the domestic politics of trade and foreign policy. By adopting a microfoundations approach, focusing on agency rather than outcomes, future research can unify disparate literatures and contradictory findings to gain new insights into the nature of trade and war.},

It distinguishes between two main senses of the term: the totality of phenomena and their laws, including human actions, and phenomena independent of human agency.  Using the first sense, acting "according to nature" is a meaningless imperative, since humans are necessarily part of nature and act within its laws.  The second sense, advocating for the imitation of nature as a moral guide, is deemed irrational and immoral. Irrational because human action's purpose is often to modify nature for the better, and immoral because nature itself perpetrates acts considered criminal in human society (killing, torture, indifference to suffering). The work critiques the idea that apparent evils in nature serve a greater good, arguing that even if true, imitating such behavior remains unacceptable.  Furthermore, while acknowledging that good often arises from evil, the reverse is equally true.  The essay proposes that nature is not a model for human conduct, but rather a scheme to be improved by human reason and ethics. It criticizes the elevation of instinct over reason, suggesting that most human virtues result from overcoming, not following, instincts. Finally, it argues for a higher standard of morality based on reason, benevolence, and a sense of unity with all humanity. – AI-generated abstract.},

 Mosquito‐borne diseases cause a major burden of
                  disease worldwide. The vital rates of these ectothermic
                  vectors and parasites respond strongly and nonlinearly to
                  temperature and therefore to climate change. Here, we review
                  how trait‐based approaches can synthesise and mechanistically
                  predict the temperature dependence of transmission across
                  vectors, pathogens, and environments. We present 11 pathogens
                  transmitted by 15 different mosquito species – including
                  globally important diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika –
                  synthesised from previously published studies. Transmission
                  varied strongly and unimodally with temperature, peaking at
                  23–29{ºC} and declining to zero below 9–23{ºC} and above
                  32–38{ºC}. Different traits restricted transmission at low
                  versus high temperatures, and temperature effects on
                  transmission varied by both mosquito and parasite species.
                  Temperate pathogens exhibit broader thermal ranges and cooler
                  thermal minima and optima than tropical pathogens. Among
                  tropical pathogens, malaria and Ross River virus had lower
                  thermal optima (25–26{ºC}) while dengue and Zika viruses had
                  the highest (29{ºC}) thermal optima. We expect warming to
                  increase transmission below thermal optima but decrease
                  transmission above optima. Key directions for future work
                  include linking mechanistic models to field transmission,
                  combining temperature effects with control measures,
                  incorporating trait variation and temperature variation, and
                  investigating climate adaptation and migration.},

                  datasets that are directly or indirectly linked to demographic
                  and economic trends during this two-century period: Written
                  sources, legislation, coinage, papyri, inscriptions, pollen,

                  has a clear independent link to plague outbreaks and none

                  we argue that this paradigm does not fit the evidence. We
                  examine a series of independent quantitative and qualitative
                  datasets that are directly or indirectly linked to demographic
                  and economic trends during this two-century period: Written
                  sources, legislation, coinage, papyri, inscriptions, pollen,
                  ancient {DNA}, and mortuary archaeology. Individually or
                  together, they fail to support the maximalist paradigm: None
                  has a clear independent link to plague outbreaks and none
                  supports maximalist reconstructions of late antique plague.
                  Instead of large-scale, disruptive mortality, when
                  contextualized and examined together, the datasets suggest
                  continuity across the plague period. Although demographic,
                  economic, and political changes continued between the 6th and
                  8th centuries, the evidence does not support the now
                  commonplace claim that the Justinianic Plague was a primary
                  causal factor of them.},

	abstract = {In the last thirty years, there have been fierce debates over how civilizations develop and why the West became so powerful.The Measure of Civilizationpresents a brand-new way of investigating these questions and provides new tools for assessing the long-term growth of societies. Using a groundbreaking numerical index of social development that compares societies in different times and places, award-winning author Ian Morris sets forth a sweeping examination of Eastern and Western development across 15,000 years since the end of the last ice age. He offers surprising conclusions about when and why the West came to dominate the world and fresh perspectives for thinking about the twenty-first century. Adapting the United Nations' approach for measuring human development, Morris's index breaks social development into four traits--energy capture per capita, organization, information technology, and war-making capacity--and he uses archaeological, historical, and current government data to quantify patterns. Morris reveals that for 90 percent of the time since the last ice age, the world's most advanced region has been at the western end of Eurasia, but contrary to what many historians once believed, there were roughly 1,200 years--from about 550 to 1750 {CE}--when an East Asian region was more advanced. Only in the late eighteenth century {CE}, when northwest Europeans tapped into the energy trapped in fossil fuels, did the West leap ahead. Resolving some of the biggest debates in global history,The Measure of Civilizationputs forth innovative tools for determining past, present, and future economic and social trends.},

The direct risks include an increased likelihood of nuclear conflict, driven by the difficulty of deterrence among multiple nuclear states, the pursuit of "usable" nuclear weapons, and the erosion of non-proliferation norms. Competition also fuels proxy wars, making them longer, bloodier, and more prone to escalation. Indirectly, the focus on relative gains over shared benefits leads to a breakdown in global cooperation, hindering progress on transnational issues like pandemics and climate change. This results in policy fragmentation, increased restrictions on the activities of non-governmental organizations, and a weakening of international institutions. These dangers are amplified by rising nationalist ideologies and a general decay of trust in expertise. Counteracting these trends requires investing in new research on the mechanisms of cooperation, educating the public and policymakers on foreign policy risks, and developing alternative political frameworks that can overcome the failures of both traditional globalism and reactionary nationalism. – AI-generated abstract.},

	abstract = {Before modern times, only nature was capable of engineering
                  pathogens. This ability was by no means unimpressive:
                  evolution has repeatedly demonstrated a formidable capacity
                  for producing a vast array of infectious agents. Pathogens
                  such as Variola major and Yersinia pestis, which cause
                  smallpox and plague respectively, wielded enough destructive
                  power to shape parts of human history. However, recent
                  advancements in biotechnology mean it is now possible to
                  engineer new viruses and bacteria. Developments in the field
                  of synthetic biology present many exciting opportunities,
                  enabling better understanding of disease-causing agents and

This work develops a method to quantify inter-nation tension by first calculating a theoretical military expenditure (M.E.Th.) based solely on GNP, using data from 63 countries for the years 1964-1966. A "Tension Ratio" (T.R.) is then derived by dividing a nation's actual M.E. by its M.E.Th. Statistical analysis demonstrates a significant correlation between high T.R. values and involvement in armed conflict. Of the nations engaged in war, 76.9\% had a T.R. greater than 155, whereas only 26\% of nations not at war exceeded this threshold. The association remains significant when comparing T.R. values to wars that occurred in subsequent years, suggesting that the T.R. can serve as a predictive tool to identify critical situations. The study also finds that geography (such as proximity to a hostile neighbor) and neutrality appear to have a greater impact on a nation's tension level than membership in a military alliance. – AI-generated abstract.},

Not only is the cliché flawed-preexisting passions are rare and have little to do with how most people end up loving their work-but it can also be dangerous, leading to anxiety and chronic job hopping. After making his case against passion, Newport sets out on a quest to discover the reality of how people end up loving what they do. Spending time with organic farmers, venture capitalists, screenwriters, freelance computer programmers, and others who admitted to deriving great satisfaction from their work, Newport uncovers the strategies they used and the pitfalls they avoided in developing their compelling careers. Matching your job to a preexisting passion does not matter, he reveals. Passion comes after you put in the hard work to become excellent at something valuable, not before. In other words, what you do for a living is much less important than how you do it. With a title taken from the comedian Steve Martin, who once said his advice for aspiring entertainers was to "be so good they can't ignore you," Cal Newport's clearly written manifesto is mandatory reading for anyone fretting about what to do with their life, or frustrated by their current job situation and eager to find a fresh new way to take control of their livelihood. He provides an evidence-based blueprint for creating work you love. SO GOOD THEY CAN'T IGNORE YOU will change the way we think about our careers, happiness, and the crafting of a remarkable life.},

Bringing together all the important issues surrounding the climate debate, Nordhaus describes the science, economics, and politics involved—and the steps necessary to reduce the perils of global warming. Using language accessible to any concerned citizen and taking care to present different points of view fairly, he discusses the problem from start to finish: from the beginning, where warming originates in our personal energy use, to the end, where societies employ regulations or taxes or subsidies to slow the emissions of gases responsible for climate change. Nordhaus offers a new analysis of why earlier policies, such as the Kyoto Protocol, failed to slow carbon dioxide emissions, how new approaches can succeed, and which policy tools will most effectively reduce emissions. In short, he clarifies a defining problem of our times and lays out the next critical steps for slowing the trajectory of global warming.},

It turns out that the pleasure of having positive fantasies about the future saps our energy to perform the hard work of meeting challenges. We enjoy our dreams rather than taking action toward making them real. A better approach is what oettingen calls 'mental contrasting' in which we still dream about the future, but also visualize the barriers that stand in our way. Adding an element of realism makes all the difference. In rigorous studies, people who tried mental contrasting became more motivated to quit smoking, lose weight, get better grades, sustain healthier relationships, and negotiate more effectively at work. Leading readers through a journey of scientific exploration, this book shows why we should rethink one of the most cherished tenets of modern psychology.},

While the symbolic nuances of words and actions such as these are regular concerns for foreign policy practitioners, the subject has never been emphasized in international relations theory.

Those who theorize about norms, ideas, and institutions tend to be open to the importance of symbolism, but they have not drawn out its details. Barry O'Neill's Honor, Symbols, and War puts symbolism at the center of the discussion. O'Neill uses the mathematical theory of games to study a network of concepts important in international negotiation and conflict resolution: symbolism, honor, face, prestige, insults, and apologies. His analysis clarifies the symbolic dynamics of several phenomena, including leadership, prenegotiation maneuvers, crisis tension, and arms-control agreements.},

The relationship between the US and China, the world's two superpowers, is peculiarly volatile. It rests on a seismic fault-of cultural misunderstanding, historical grievance, and ideological incompatibility. No other nations are so quick to offend and be offended. Their militaries play a dangerous game of chicken, corporations steal intellectual property, intelligence satellites peer, and AI technicians plot. The capacity for either country to cross a fatal line grows daily. Kevin Rudd, a former Australian prime minister who has studied, lived in, and worked with China for more than forty years, is one of the very few people who can offer real insight into the mindsets of the leadership whose judgment will determine if a war will be fought. The Avoidable War demystifies the actions of both sides, explaining and translating them for the benefit of the other. Geopolitical disaster is still avoidable, but only if these two giants can find a way to coexist without betraying their core interests through what Rudd calls "managed strategic competition." Should they fail, down that path lies the possibility of a war that could rewrite the future of both countries, and the world.

It is therefore worth constructing the best possible forecasts of policy-relevant aspects of AI development trajectories—even though, at this early stage, the unknowns must remain very large.

We propose that one factor that can usefully constrain models of AI development is the "intelligibility of intelligence"—the extent to which efficient algorithms for general intelligence follow from simple general principles, as in physics, as opposed to being necessarily a conglomerate of special case solutions. Specifically, we argue that estimates of the "intelligibility of intelligence" bear on:

• Whether human-level AI will come about through a conceptual breakthrough, rather than through either the gradual addition of hardware, or the gradual accumulation of special-case hacks;

• Whether the invention of human-level AI will, therefore, come without much warning;

• Whether, if AI progress comes through neuroscience, neuroscientific knowledge will enable brain-inspired human-level intelligences (as researchers "see why the brain works") before it enables whole brain emulation;

• Whether superhuman AIs, once created, will have a large advantage over humans in designing still more powerful AI algorithms;

• Whether AI intelligence growth may therefore be rather sudden past the human level; and

• Whether it may be humanly possible to understand intelligence well enough, and to design powerful AI architectures that are sufficiently transparent, to create demonstrably safe AIs far above the human level.

The intelligibility of intelligence thus provides a means of constraining long-term AI forecasting by suggesting relationships between several unknowns in AI development trajectories. Also, we can improve our estimates of the intelligibility of intelligence, e.g. by examining the evolution of animal intelligence, and the track record of AI research to date.},

                  bird mortality. The current understanding of daytime
                  collisions is limited by a lack of empirical data on how
                  collisions occur in the real world because most data are
                  collected by recording evidence of mortality rather than
                  pre-collision behaviour. Based on published literature
                  suggesting a causal relationship between bird collision risk
                  and the appearance of reflections on glass, the fact that
                  reflections vary in appearance depending on viewing angle, and
                  general principles of object collision kinematics, we
                  hypothesized that the risk and lethality of window collisions
                  may be related to the angle and velocity of birds’ flight. We
                  deployed a home security camera system to passively record
                  interactions between common North American bird species and
                  residential windows in a backyard setting over spring, summer
                  and fall seasons over 2 years. We captured 38 events including
                  29 collisions and nine near-misses in which birds approached
                  the glass but avoided impact. Only two of the collisions
                  resulted in immediate fatality, while 23 birds flew away
                  immediately following impact. Birds approached the glass at
                  variable flight speeds and from a wide range of angles,
                  suggesting that the dynamic appearance of reflections on glass
                  at different times of day may play a causal role in collision
                  risk. Birds that approached the window at higher velocity were
                  more likely to be immediately killed or stunned. Most
                  collisions were not detected by the building occupants and,
                  given that most birds flew away immediately, carcass surveys
                  would only document a small fraction of window collisions. We
                  discuss the implications of characterizing pre-collision
                  behaviour for designing effective collision prevention

	abstract = {This work addresses the challenge of mitigating catastrophic risks from advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) by proposing an "AI control" approach, which assumes misalignment, particularly from "scheming" AIs—those strategically pursuing goals counter to human interests while potentially feigning alignment or sabotaging safety efforts. Instead of focusing on preventing AIs from becoming schemers (P(scheming)), this approach concentrates on reducing the probability of catastrophic outcomes given a scheming AI (P(doom | scheming)). The core premise is that evaluating and constraining AI capabilities is more tractable than ensuring their internal alignment. AI control aims to build systems robust to adversarial AI behavior, analogous to how organizations manage insider threats by assuming compromise and designing resilient systems. Techniques explored include trusted monitoring, where less capable but more reliable AIs review outputs from powerful, untrusted AIs, and untrusted monitoring with collusion-busting mechanisms like redaction and paraphrasing to prevent covert coordination. The objective is to establish a framework where AI deployment and system design are inherently secure against deceptive AIs, potentially offering significant risk reduction for AIs capable of outperforming human experts, though challenges remain for hypothetical superintelligences. – AI-generated abstract.},

It focuses on a scenario within an AI company where ten safety-concerned individuals operate with limited political will, budget, and influence, attempting to mitigate risks despite the company's general disregard for specific misalignment threats. For these internal agents, interventions must be cheap, require minimal compute, and impose low compliance overhead to avoid being reversed. Proposed actions include gathering evidence of risk, implementing direct safety measures, and conducting alignment research. The author posits that such groups, even with minimal resources, could substantially reduce risk, highlighting the need for planning exportable safety research and external assistance, and advocating for current research to prioritize low-budget safety techniques applicable in these constrained environments. – AI-generated abstract.},

                  Effect–influences academic output and careers. Given the
                  challenge and uncertainty of gauging the quality of academic
                  research, gatekeepers often possess incentives to prefer the
                  work of established academics. Such preferences breach
                  scientific norms of universalism and can stifle innovation.
                  This article analyzes repeat authors within academic journals
                  as a possible exemplar of the Matthew Effect. Using
                  publication data for 347 economics journals from 1980–2017, as
                  well as from three major generalist science journals, we
                  analyze how articles written by repeat authors fare vis-à-vis
                  less-experienced authors. Results show that articles written
                  by repeat authors steadily decline in citation impact with
                  each additional repeat authorship. Despite these declines,
                  repeat authors also tend to garner more citations than debut
                  authors. These contrasting results suggest both benefits and
                  drawbacks associated with repeat authorships. Journals appear
                  to respond to feedback from previous publications, as
                  more-cited authors in a journal are more likely to be selected
                  for repeat authorships. Institutional characteristics of
                  journals also affect the likelihood of repeat authorship, as
                  well as citation outcomes. Repeat authorships–particularly in
                  leading academic journals–reflect innovative incentives and
                  professional reward structures, while also influencing the
                  intellectual content of science.},

	abstract = {Arguments for a conditional obligation of effective altruism, which assert that if one makes charitable donations one is morally required to maximize the good achieved, are critically examined. Such arguments, particularly those advanced by Theron Pummer and Joe Horton, derive from "Rescue Cases" that suggest a conditional duty to save as many people as possible if one is to save anyone at all. This approach is characterized as "half-hearted non-consequentialism" because it views moral options as licensed deviations from a background presumption of optimizing action, justified primarily by costs to the agent. A "thoroughgoing non-consequentialism," by contrast, rejects this optimizing default and grounds morality in duties and claims. This alternative framework offers a more compelling analysis of rescue cases, preserving a distinction between duties to meet claims and supererogatory acts, and better accommodating the moral significance of the "separateness of persons" in situations involving conflicting claims. Consequently, the half-hearted non-consequentialist defenses of the conditional obligation of effective altruism are flawed. While a thoroughgoing non-consequentialist version of the Rescue Argument might be constructed, its reliance on extensive individual duties of rescue is disputable, and its conclusions would be significantly more limited, applying solely to the satisfaction of claims rather than all optional beneficent actions, and potentially not mandating numerical maximization in all conflict scenarios. – AI-generated abstract.},

                  global species extinctions. However, the majority of available
                  data supporting this contention is largely anecdotal. We used
                  the {IUCN} Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species and
                  literature indexed in the {ISI} Web of Science to assess the
                  role of infectious disease in global species loss. Infectious
                  disease was listed as a contributing factor in {\textless}4\%
                  of species extinctions known to have occurred since 1500 (833
                  plants and animals) and as contributing to a species' status
                  as critically endangered in {\textless}8\% of cases (2,852
                  critically endangered plants and animals). Although infectious

                  our findings underscore two important limitations in the
                  available evidence: uncertainty surrounding the threats to
                  species survival and a temporal bias in the data. Several
                  initiatives could help overcome these obstacles, including
                  rigorous scientific tests to determine which infectious
                  diseases present a significant threat at the species level,

While acknowledging EA's principle that individuals should reduce suffering without significant personal sacrifice, the critique asserts that EA's focus on individual philanthropic giving, exemplified by the drowning child analogy, abstracts from and implicitly exonerates the systemic dynamics of capitalism. The article contends that capitalism actively creates "drowning strangers" by commodifying necessities, determining purchasing power, extracting resources from developing nations, and making access to life-sustaining goods contingent on profit. Consequently, EA's "black box" approach to charity and its emphasis on individual moral dilemmas are seen as diverting attention from the need for radical systemic change. The author suggests that the moral imperative invoked by EA should be applied instead to challenge the capitalist class and an economic system that prioritizes accumulation over basic human needs, rather than solely promoting a "culture of giving" that operates within capital's terms. – AI-generated abstract.},

The argument that deep engagement is necessary to cultivate local knowledge is flawed, as historical and contemporary evidence shows dominant powers consistently fail to achieve such nuanced understanding. Imperial Rome and China's interventions in peripheral territories often inadvertently created or strengthened the very threats they aimed to contain. Likewise, decades of modern American global engagement have not prevented repeated strategic surprises, demonstrating that this approach does not reliably produce the required regional acumen. A successful foreign policy must therefore be designed to operate effectively without depending on a level of expertise the American system is structurally ill-equipped to develop. – AI-generated abstract.},

The second part turns to specifically regional experiences, and the third offers more specialized chapters on key topics in the modern history of death. Historical findings and debates feed directly into a current and prospective assessment of death, as many societies transition into patterns of ageing that will further alter the death experience and challenge modern reactions. Thus, a final chapter probes this topic, by way of introducing the links between historical experience and current trajectories, ensuring that the book gives the reader a framework for assessing the ongoing process, as well as an understanding of the past. Global in focus and linking death to a variety of major developments in modern global history, the volume is ideal for all those interested in the multifaceted history of how death is dealt with in different societies over time and who want access to the rich and growing historiography on the subject},

	abstract = {Once humanoid robots achieve capabilities sufficient to substitute for human physical labor, their production could scale rapidly. Manufacturing costs are projected to decrease substantially with production volume, potentially falling from an initial \$100,000 per unit to under \$10,000, enabling operating costs below \$1 per hour. This significant cost advantage over human labor would likely create massive global demand, estimated at a scale of one billion units annually. Such production levels could potentially be reached within five years by converting existing industrial capacity, particularly from the automotive sector, based on comparable material throughput. The timeline for this industrial transformation could be further compressed by the application of advanced AI to manage logistics and factory construction, and by utilizing the initial output of robots to build subsequent manufacturing facilities, suggesting a scale-up pace that could significantly exceed historical precedents. – AI-generated abstract.},

	abstract = {This is one of two posts I’m putting up today on how little economic theory alone has to say about the effects full automation would have on familiar economic variables.The other is “The ambiguous effect of full automation on wages”.For a more interesting but more mathematically complex illustration of the dynamic I'm trying to illustrate in this post, see Hyperbolic goods, exponential {GDP}.{IntroductionA} lot of us are wondering what impact {AI} will have on global {GDP} growth (or would have if fully aligned and minimally regulated, in a world not destroyed by conflict). People have occasionally asked for my opinion on the question ever since I first wrote a literature review on the question five years ago—in fact before that, which is one of the reasons I wrote it! My answer has changed over time in many ways, but the outline remains similar.It seems much more likely than not to me that advanced enough {AI} would eventually result in {GWP} growth above the fastest rates of sustained “catch-up growth” we have ever seen, namely the long stretches of {\textasciitilde}10\% growth seen over the last century in several East Asian countries, in which growth was essentially bottlenecked by capital accumulation rather than technological progress.I think that radically faster growth rates are also plausible. Most growth models predict that if capital could substitute well enough for labor, the growth rate would rise {\textasciitilde}indefinitely, and none of the arguments (that I’ve come across to date) for ruling this out seem strong. But I also don’t think it makes sense to be confident that this will happen (given the work on this that I’ve come across to date), since there are some reasons why the extrapolation of ever faster {GDP} growth might break down.The example below is an attempt to succinctly communicate one of those reasons: namely that {GDP} is, on inspection, a bizarrely constructed object with no necessary connection to any intuitive notion of technological capacity. Many people are already aware of this on some level, but the disconnect seems much bigger to me than typically appreciated. I intuitively don’t think this is a very strong reason to expect slow {GDP} growth given full automation, to be clear, but I do think it’s real and underappreciated.[1]{ExampleAssume} for simplicity that everything produced is consumed immediately.We produce different kinds of goods. A good’s share at a given time is the fraction of all spending that is spent on that good. The growth rate of {GDP} at a given time is the weighted average of the growth rates of the good-quantities at that time, with each good’s weight given by its share. (We are talking about real {GDP} growth, using chain-weighting. To understand why it is standard to define {GDP} growth this way, Whelan (2001) offers a good summary.)Here is a simple illustration of how, even if our productive capacity greatly accelerates on a common-sense definition, {GDP} growth can slow.Suppose there are two goods, the population is fixed and its size is normalized to 1, and everyone has the},

Global poverty is framed as originating from colonial actions and ongoing neoliberal policies, a socio-historical context largely omitted from Singer's framework. Stripped of political and historical dimensions, EA provides a limited response to global challenges. The "earning to give" model, exemplified by working in the financial sector, is critiqued for potentially exacerbating global suffering and fostering individual alienation. Singer's preference utilitarianism, while seeking rational choice, treats individuals as abstract units, aligning with the quantifiable logic of corporate and financial systems. This perspective fosters a "win-win" ethical zone that overlooks the conflict-ridden nature of wealth distribution. Donors are encouraged to engage in economically problematic activities to maximize donations, creating a circular reasoning that risks deepening the very inequalities EA seeks to alleviate. Thus, Singer's effective altruism functions not as an antidote to global market fundamentalism, but as a complementary system reflecting its depoliticized and abstract approach. – AI-generated abstract.},

This acceleration will compress centuries of potential technological advancement into mere years, challenging human institutions and decision-making processes, which are much slower to adapt. This rapid change necessitates addressing several grand challenges: the proliferation of destructive technologies, the concentration of power, securing digital rights for potentially conscious AI, and establishing effective space governance.  AI could exacerbate existing risks, like nuclear war, or create entirely novel threats via technologies like nanotechnology or autonomous drone armies.  Additionally, the potential for a single actor to seize control of advanced AI, or unilaterally exploit space resources, necessitates proactive governance solutions.

	abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a poverty-related disease that is associated with poor living conditions. We studied TB mortality and living conditions in Bern between 1856 and 1950. Methods: We analysed cause-specific mortality based on mortality registers certified by autopsies, and public health reports 1856 to 1950 from the city council of Bern. Results: TB mortality was higher in the Black Quarter (550 per 100,000) and in the city centre (327 per 100,000), compared to the outskirts (209 per 100,000 in 1911-1915). TB mortality correlated positively with the number of persons per room (r = 0.69, p = 0.026), the percentage of rooms without sunlight (r = 0.72, p = 0.020), and negatively with the number of windows per apartment (r = -0.79, p = 0.007). TB mortality decreased 10-fold from 330 per 100,000 in 1856 to 33 per 100,000 in 1950, as housing conditions improved, indoor crowding decreased, and open-air schools, sanatoria, systematic tuberculin skin testing of school children and chest radiography screening were introduced. Conclusions: Improved living conditions and public health measures may have contributed to the massive decline of the TB epidemic in the city of Bern even before effective antibiotic treatment became finally available in the 1950s.},
