	abstract = {Deep learning has exhibited rapid progress over the past decade, with models advancing from basic image recognition to complex problem-solving and exceeding human performance on various benchmarks. This progress is driven by scaling compute, algorithmic efficiencies, and "unhobbling" gains that unlock latent model capabilities.  From GPT-2 to GPT-4, a period of roughly four years, effective compute increased by 4.5–6 orders of magnitude, coupled with significant unhobbling advancements like RLHF and chain-of-thought prompting. This led to a qualitative leap in performance comparable to the cognitive development from preschooler to high-schooler. Projecting these trends forward, another similar jump is anticipated by 2027, potentially driven by a further 3–6 order of magnitude increase in effective compute and continued unhobbling, such as improvements in long-term memory, tool use, and test-time compute.  This could lead to the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) capable of performing tasks comparable to expert humans and automating a wide range of cognitive jobs, potentially triggering rapid further advancements due to self-improving AI.  However, data limitations and the need for algorithmic breakthroughs to overcome them pose a significant source of uncertainty. – AI-generated abstract.},

	abstract = {This article analyzes the proposed conversion of OpenAI from a non-profit to a for-profit entity.  OpenAI was initially established as a non-profit due to early underestimations of the financial resources required for AI development and concerns about corporate control over advanced AI.  The organization's increasing need for capital led to the creation of a for-profit subsidiary with a capped-profit structure.  Currently, OpenAI seeks a full conversion to a for-profit model to facilitate further investment, allegedly hindered by the existing non-profit structure.  The article examines the legal and financial complexities of the proposed conversion, including the role of the non-profit board, the valuation of OpenAI, and potential legal challenges, such as a lawsuit by Elon Musk and scrutiny from state Attorneys General. The article explores the fiduciary duties of the non-profit board in ensuring a fair sale price and the potential conflict between maximizing shareholder value and the original mission of benefiting humanity.  It also discusses alternative corporate structures like Anthropic's public benefit corporation model and the potential implications of OpenAI's conversion for the future development and governance of AI, particularly in the context of a potential singularity. – AI-generated abstract.},

In biology and medicine, AI could help cure most diseases, extend human lifespan, and enhance biological capabilities. In neuroscience, it could address mental illness and improve baseline human cognitive function. Regarding economic development, AI could accelerate growth in developing nations and help reduce global inequality, though this requires deliberate effort to ensure fair distribution of benefits. In governance, AI could strengthen democratic institutions and individual rights, but only if democratic nations maintain technological leadership and deploy AI wisely. The question of meaningful work in an AI-driven economy remains challenging and may require fundamental economic restructuring.

@book{Ang2016HowChinaEscaped,
	abstract = {Before markets opened in 1978, China was an impoverished planned economy governed by a Maoist bureaucracy. In just three decades it evolved into the world's second-largest economy and is today guided by highly entrepreneurial bureaucrats. In How China Escaped the Poverty Trap, Yuen Yuen Ang explains this astonishing metamorphosis. Rather than insist that either strong institutions of good governance foster markets or that growth enables good governance, Ang lays out a new, dynamic framework for understanding development broadly. Successful development, she contends, is a coevolutionary process in which markets and governments mutually adapt. By mapping this coevolution, Ang reveals a startling conclusion: poor and weak countries can escape the poverty trap by first harnessing weak institutions—features that defy norms of good governance—to build markets. Further, she stresses that adaptive processes, though essential for development, do not automatically occur. Highlighting three universal roadblocks to adaptation, Ang identifies how Chinese reformers crafted enabling conditions for effective improvisation. How China Escaped the Poverty Trap offers the most complete synthesis to date of the numerous interacting forces that have shaped China’s dramatic makeover and the problems it faces today. Looking beyond China, Ang also traces the coevolutionary sequence of development in late medieval Europe, antebellum United States, and contemporary Nigeria, and finds surprising parallels among these otherwise disparate cases. Indispensable to all who care about development, this groundbreaking book challenges the convention of linear thinking and points to an alternative path out of poverty traps.},

Though accelerating technological development may increase the hazard rate (the risk of existential catastrophe per period) in the short run, two considerations suggest that acceleration typically decreases the risk that such a catastrophe ever occurs. First, acceleration decreases the time spent at each technology level. Second, given a policy option to sacrifice consumption for safety, acceleration motivates greater sacrifices by decreasing the marginal utility of consumption and increasing the value of the future. Under broad conditions, optimal policy thus produces an “existential risk Kuznets curve”, in which the hazard rate rises and then falls with the technology level and acceleration pulls forward a future in which risk is low. The negative impacts of acceleration on risk are offset only given policy failures, or direct contributions of acceleration to cumulative risk, that are sufficiently extreme.},

Many governments, companies, researchers, and civil society organizations are proposing, and in some cases, building global governance frameworks and institutions to promote AI safety and beneficial development. Complexity thinking, a way of viewing the world not just as discrete parts at the macro level but also in terms of bottom-up and interactive complex adaptive systems, can be a useful intellectual and scientific lens for shaping these endeavors. This paper details how insights from the science and theory of complexity can aid understanding of the challenges posed by AI and its potential impacts on society. Given the characteristics of complex adaptive systems, the paper recommends that global AI governance be based on providing a fit, adaptive response system that mitigates harmful outcomes of AI and enables positive aspects to flourish. The paper proposes components of such a system in three areas: access and power, international relations and global stability; and accountability and liability.},

Ten years after deworming treatment, men who were eligible as boys stay enrolled for more years of primary school, work 17\% more hours each week, spend more time in nonagricultural self-employment, are more likely to hold manufacturing jobs, and miss one fewer meal per week. Women who were in treatment schools as girls are approximately one quarter more likely to have attended secondary school, halving the gender gap. They reallocate time from traditional agriculture into cash crops and nonagricultural self-employment.

	abstract = {Reasoning models, large language models trained via reinforcement learning, excel at “pure reasoning tasks”—abstract tasks with cheaply verifiable correct answers, like mathematical theorem proving.  Reinforcement learning significantly improves large language model performance, potentially enabling superhuman reasoning abilities in the near future. The effectiveness of reinforcement learning hinges on the low cost of solution verification, allowing for dense reward signals during training. Consequently, rapid advancements are expected in fields like mathematics and computer programming. However, economically valuable tasks often involve skills and nuanced expertise not readily found in training data or easily verifiable, hindering automation in areas like video editing and general robotics. Therefore, while reasoning models may soon surpass human capabilities in specific domains, automating most economically valuable tasks will likely remain challenging.  Reasoning models are unlikely to fundamentally disrupt the training-inference compute tradeoff or the existing business model of AI labs.  Further breakthroughs are needed in multimodality, autonomy, long-term memory, and robotics to fully realize AI’s potential for automating valuable economic work. – AI-generated abstract.},

                  and government procurement contracts, as well as on social
                  unrest across China since the early 2010s. We first show that
                  autocrats benefit from {AI}: local unrest leads to greater
                  government procurement of facial-recognition {AI} as a new
                  technology of political control, and increased {AI}
                  procurement indeed suppresses subsequent unrest. We show that
                  {AI} innovation benefits from autocrats’ suppression of
                  unrest: the contracted {AI} firms innovate more both for the

We introduce a conceptual framework which helps identify adaptive interventions that avoid, defend against and remedy potentially harmful uses of {AI} systems, illustrated with examples in election manipulation, cyberterrorism, and loss of control to {AI} decision-makers.

Whether it is a matter of giving to charity, or sticking to duty, or insisting on our rights, we can be confused, or be paralysed by the fear that our principles are groundless. Many are afraid that in a Godless world science has unmasked us as creatures fated by our genes to be selfish and tribalistic, or competitive and aggressive. Simon Blackburn, author of the best-selling Think, structures this short introduction around these and other threats to ethics. Confronting seven different objections to our self-image as moral, well-behaved creatures, he charts a course through the philosophical quicksands that often engulf us. Then, turning to problems of life and death, he shows how we should think about the meaning of life, and how we should mistrust the sound-bite sized absolutes that often dominate moral debates. Finally he offers a critical tour of the ways the philosophical tradition has tried to provide foundations for ethics, from Plato and Aristotle through to contemporary debates.},

Furthermore, we controlled for different variables such as age, gender, and marital status. Contradictory to the hypotheses development, the results of the Cohen’s path analysis indicate that the causal direction from happiness to charitable giving is the more dominant one. Through the study and our initial results we contribute to theory by highlighting the ambiguous causal relationship between the focal constructs and provide a statistical method to investigate such unclear causal relationships.

The importance of proactively anticipating threats through biosecurity intelligence is highlighted. The episode also details the proposed creation of a new international organization dedicated to biosecurity, with a focus on strengthening governance of bioscience research and development. The episode emphasizes the need for a layered defense approach to reducing GCBRs, targeting multiple intervention points throughout the bioscience research lifecycle, including funding, research oversight, material supply, and publication. The podcast highlights the need to address the capabilities gap in international mechanisms for investigating the origins of high-consequence biological events and the proposed creation of a Joint Assessment Mechanism for that purpose. The episode further discusses the potential role of traditional law enforcement in detecting and disrupting bioterrorism threats, underscoring the need for strengthened collaboration between law enforcement and the scientific community.

This book argues that voters are irrational not because they are ignorant, but because they prioritize their psychological well-being over their material well-being. Because their votes are unlikely to change the outcome of an election, voters face no material cost for indulging their false beliefs. Politicians, for their part, are not primarily driven by self-interest, but by the desire to win elections by conforming to voter preferences.

While contemporary physics suggests our causal influence may be finite, non-zero credences on different physical theories and decision theories mean infinite ethics remains relevant to practical decision-making. The problems of infinite ethics put serious pressure on various ethical principles, including those underlying arguments for longtermism. Common approaches like totalism, averages, hyperreals, expansionism, and simplicity weightings each face significant difficulties when applied to infinite cases. These challenges puncture the dream of a simple, bullet-biting utilitarianism and affect all ethical frameworks. The best current response may be to help humanity reach a wise and technologically mature future with superior theoretical understanding and practical capabilities. However, reflection on infinite ethics suggests that such a future's ethical priorities could be quite different from naive extrapolations of finite ethical views. The work examines specific impossibility results, explores various proposed solutions and their limitations, and discusses implications for both practical decision-making and theoretical ethics. – AI-generated abstract},

Real thinking emerges when the mind genuinely attempts to make contact with truth rather than merely manipulating symbols or defending predetermined positions. Several practical techniques can help cultivate real thinking, including slowing down, following authentic curiosity, maintaining awareness of purpose, tethering concepts to concrete referents, and imagining being wrong in multiple directions. The capacity for real thinking becomes especially crucial as humanity enters an era of transformative artificial intelligence, where unprecedented changes may require rapid and substantial updates to existing conceptual frameworks.

	abstract = {I’d like to thank Grace Helton, Terry Horgan, and Christopher Peacocke for their rich commentaries on my book Reality+. As it happens, all three focus on the simulation hypothesis: the hypothesis that we are living in a lifelong computer simulation. Where the simulation hypothesis is concerned, I have three main theses in the book: (i) Metaphysics: If we’re in a simulation, the objects around us are real; (ii) Epistemology: We can’t know we’re not in a simulation; and (iii) Value: We can live a good life in a simulation. The three commentators address all three of these theses. Horgan argues against the metaphysical thesis. Peacocke argues against both the metaphysical and the epistemological thesis. Helton uses epistemological considerations to argue against a version of the value thesis.

@Report{Chancel2022InformeSobreDesigualdad,
	abstract = {La desigualdad de ingresos y riqueza ha aumentado en casi todos los países desde la década de 1980, especialmente en países como Estados Unidos, Rusia e India.  Esto se ha debido a programas de desregulación y liberalización que se han aplicado en distintos países.  La desigualdad global de ingresos ha disminuido en las últimas décadas, pero la desigualdad dentro de los países se ha incrementado considerablemente, haciendo que la desigualdad mundial se acerque a los niveles del siglo XX.  La desigualdad de riqueza también ha aumentado en la parte superior de la distribución, con un 1\% superior que se ha llevado el 38\% de toda la riqueza adicional acumulada desde mediados de la década de 1990.  Las desigualdades de género siguen siendo notables, con las mujeres ganando aproximadamente el 35\% de todos los ingresos laborales.  Las emisiones de CO2 también están desigualmente distribuidas, con el 10\% superior de los emisores responsables de cerca del 50\% de todas las emisiones.  El informe sugiere que para abordar estos desafíos del siglo XXI se necesita una redistribución significativa de las desigualdades de ingresos y riqueza, similar a lo que ocurrió con la creación de los estados de bienestar modernos en el siglo XX.  Se proponen políticas como un impuesto progresivo sobre el patrimonio para recaudar recursos y financiar la inversión en educación, salud y la transición ecológica. - Resumen generado por inteligencia artificial.},

@Report{Chancel2022WorldInequalityReport,
	abstract = {The world remains highly unequal in income and wealth, despite the decline of international inequalities in recent decades. The share of global income captured by the bottom 50\% of the population is only 8.5\%, while the richest 10\% hold 76\% of global wealth. This inequality is driven by both between-country and within-country disparities. In the 19th and early 20th century, colonial empires and unequal economic and political systems contributed to growing inequalities both between and within countries. The rise of welfare states in the mid-20th century led to a decline in within-country inequalities in most high-income countries, but since the 1980s, these have been rising again. This has partially offset the decline in between-country inequalities, leading to a stabilization of global inequalities. Global carbon inequality is similarly pronounced, with the top 10\% of emitters responsible for nearly half of all emissions.  The report emphasizes the role of progressive wealth taxes and international cooperation in reducing income and wealth inequality. It also highlights the need for a global asset register and a minimum tax on multinational profits. – AI-generated abstract.},

Giving by individuals has been increasing in both nominal and inflation-adjusted dollars in the past few years, although it has not yet recovered to pre-recession levels. There is a U-shaped relationship between total adjusted gross income and charitable giving as a percentage of adjusted gross income, meaning that those at the high end and low end of the income distribution tend to give a higher percentage of their income as contributions. Despite lower household giving, those who contribute to religious organizations tend to give more in dollars per donation and as a percentage of income.

@book{Cialdini2006InfluencePsychologyOf,
	abstract = {In this highly acclaimed New York Times bestseller, Dr. Robert B. Cialdini—the seminal expert in the field of influence and persuasion—explains the psychology of why people say yes and how to apply these principles ethically in business and everyday situations.

You’ll learn the six universal principles of influence and how to use them to become a skilled persuader—and, just as importantly, how to defend yourself against dishonest influence attempts:

Reciprocation: The internal pull to repay what another person has provided us.
Commitment and Consistency: Once we make a choice or take a stand, we work to behave consistently with that commitment in order to justify our decisions.
Social Proof: When we are unsure, we look to similar others to provide us with the correct actions to take. And the more, people undertaking that action, the more we consider that action correct.
Liking: The propensity to agree with people we like and, just as important, the propensity for others to agree with us, if we like them.
Authority: We are more likely to say “yes” to others who are authorities, who carry greater knowledge, experience or expertise.
Scarcity: We want more of what is less available or dwindling in availability.
Understanding and applying the six principles ethically is cost-free and deceptively easy. Backed by Dr. Cialdini’s 35 years of evidence-based, peer-reviewed scientific research—as well as by a three-year field study on what moves people to change behavior—Influence is a comprehensive guide to using these principles effectively to amplify your ability to change the behavior of others.},

The risk is further heightened by the possibility of accidental war caused by technical malfunction or miscalculation, or by intentional decisions made by leaders who perceive themselves to be in a favorable position to achieve their goals through force. Although there is some possibility of human extinction or societal collapse from a great power war, the risk to the long-term future is more likely to come from the effects of a large-scale conflict that disrupts global institutions, power balances, and technological development. – AI-generated abstract},

But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions - doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits. In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.

The official poverty measure defines poverty by comparing pretax money income to a poverty threshold that is adjusted by family composition. The SPM expands the official poverty measure by accounting for many of the government programs that are designed to assist low-income families, but are not included in the official poverty measure. The SPM also includes federal and state taxes and work and medical expenses. In addition, the SPM accounts for geographic variation in poverty thresholds, while the official poverty measure does not. The report highlights that the SPM poverty rate in 2021 was 7.8 percent, a decrease of 1.4 percentage points from 2020, while the official poverty rate remained largely unchanged from 2020. This divergence in poverty rates is attributed to the effects of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), which provided households with additional resources in the form of stimulus payments, expansions to refundable tax credits, and pandemic-specific school lunch benefits. The SPM accounts for these policy changes, while the official poverty measure does not.  – AI-generated abstract},

@report{Deming2015GrowingImportanceOf,
	abstract = {The labor market increasingly rewards social skills. Between 1980 and 2012, jobs requiring high levels of social interaction grew by nearly 12 percentage points as a share of the U.S. labor force. Math-intensive but less social jobs - including many STEM occupations - shrank by 3.3 percentage points over the same period. Employment and wage growth was particularly strong for jobs requiring high levels of both math skill and social skill. To understand these patterns, I develop a model of team production where workers “trade tasks” to exploit their comparative advantage. In the model, social skills reduce coordination costs, allowing workers to specialize and work together more efficiently. The model generates predictions about sorting and the relative returns to skill across occupations, which I investigate using data from the NLSY79 and the NLSY97. Using a comparable set of skill measures and covariates across survey waves, I find that the labor market return to social skills was much greater in the 2000s than in the mid 1980s and 1990s.

	abstract = {This study provides an updated assessment of the global burden of diseases and injuries, expanding on previous research by including subnational assessments for five new countries and adding twelve new causes to the modelling framework. Global health has improved over the past three decades, as measured by age-standardized disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) rates. However, the absolute number of DALYs has remained stable, indicating the need for continued investment in health systems. Notable changes in disease patterns include a sharp decline in chronic hepatitis C cases in Egypt due to mass screening and treatment, and a rise in drug use disorder deaths globally, with the United States experiencing more than half of all global overdose deaths in 2019. The study highlights the growing importance of understanding the burden of disability, particularly in light of the aging global population, and underscores the need for continued research and development of interventions addressing non-communicable diseases and injuries. The findings also emphasize the potential for low-income countries to make substantial progress in improving health outcomes through targeted investments. – AI-generated abstract},

Numerous empirical studies have been conducted in recent years to verify the effects of these interventions. This paper provides a systematic review and the first meta-analysis of PPIs at work, highlighting intervention studies explicitly aligned within the theoretical traditions of positive work and organizations (PWO). We draw from streams of PWO, including positive organizational scholarship (POS), positive organizational behavior (POB) and positive organizational psychology literature (POP) to evaluate PPIs at work. The meta-analytic findings from 22 studies showed that the five workplace positive psychology interventions had a small positive effect on improving desirable work outcomes (g = .25), and a small to moderate effect on reducing undesirable work outcomes (g = −.34). Thus, this paper provides valuable insight on the effectiveness of PPIs at work and future directions for scholars and practitioners.},

Why do some people succeed and others fail? Sharing new insights from her landmark research on grit, {MacArthur} "genius" Angela Duckworth explains why talent is hardly a guarantor of success. Rather, other factors can be even more crucial such as identifying our passions and following through on our commitments. Drawing on her own powerful story as the daughter of a scientist who frequently bemoaned her lack of smarts, Duckworth describes her winding path through teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience, which led to the hypothesis that what really drives success is not "genius" but a special blend of passion and long-term perseverance. As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Duckworth created her own "character lab" and set out to test her theory. Here, she takes readers into the field to visit teachers working in some of the toughest schools, cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she's learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers--from {JP} Morgan {CEO} Jamie Dimon to the cartoon editor of The New Yorker to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll. Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that--not talent or luck--makes all the difference"--},

The book then proceeds to argue that Robust Realism about normativity, the view defended, is not committed to an unacceptable or mysterious metaphysics, that it can successfully face epistemological challenges, that it does not face insuperable problems from moral disagreement, and that it can accommodate the plausibility of action for (speciﬁc) reasons. – AI-generated abstract.},

Using Shapley values to attribute performance improvements, we find that algorithmic improvements have been roughly as important as the scaling of compute for progress computer vision. Our estimates indicate that algorithmic innovations mostly take the form of compute-augmenting algorithmic advances (which enable researchers to get better performance from less compute), not data-augmenting algorithmic advances. We find that compute-augmenting algorithmic advances are made at a pace more than twice as fast as the rate usually associated with Moore's law. In particular, we estimate that compute-augmenting innovations halve compute requirements every nine months (95\% confidence interval: 4 to 25 months).},

Against this backdrop, we evaluate nine counterarguments, including regulatory hurdles, production bottlenecks, alignment issues, and the pace of automation. We tentatively assess these arguments, finding most are unlikely deciders. We conclude that explosive growth seems plausible with {AI} capable of broadly substituting for human labor, but high confidence in this claim seems currently unwarranted. Key questions remain about the intensity of regulatory responses to {AI}, physical bottlenecks in production, the economic value of superhuman abilities, and the rate at which {AI} automation could occur.},

Peak condenses three decades of original research to introduce an incredibly powerful approach to learning that is fundamentally different from the way people traditionally think about acquiring a skill.   Ericsson’s findings have been lauded and debated, but never properly explained. So the idea of expertise still intimidates us — we believe we need innate talent to excel, or think excelling seems prohibitively difficult.  Peak belies both of these notions, proving that almost all of us have the seeds of excellence within us — it’s just a question of nurturing them by reducing expertise to a discrete series of attainable practices. Peak offers invaluable, often counterintuitive, advice on setting goals, getting feedback, identifying patterns, and motivating yourself.

The authors argue that the traditional focus on nation-states as the primary drivers of economic growth is no longer valid in a globalized world, where capital and talent flow freely across borders. Mega-regions, defined as integrated sets of cities and their surrounding suburban hinterlands, are increasingly becoming the natural economic units of the global economy. The authors use a global dataset of nighttime light emissions to systematically define and analyze the world’s largest mega-regions, estimating their economic activity, population, technological innovation (using patent data), and scientific innovation (using data on highly cited scientific authors). They find that a small number of mega-regions – only 40 out of thousands of cities – account for a disproportionate share of global economic activity and innovation. The authors conclude that geography and location still matter in a globalized world, and that understanding the role of human capital externalities in the formation and functioning of mega-regions is an important task for future research.  – AI-generated abstract},

@article{Fowler2008DynamicSpreadOf,
	abstract = {Objectives To evaluate whether happiness can spread from person to person and whether niches of happiness form within social networks.
Design Longitudinal social network analysis.
Setting Framingham Heart Study social network.
Participants 4739 individuals followed from 1983 to 2003.
Main outcome measures Happiness measured with validated four item scale; broad array of attributes of social networks and diverse social ties.
Results Clusters of happy and unhappy people are visible in the network, and the relationship between people’s happiness extends up to three degrees of separation (for example, to the friends of one’s friends’ friends). People who are surrounded by many happy people and those who are central in the network are more likely to become happy in the future. Longitudinal statistical models suggest that clusters of happiness result from the spread of happiness and not just a tendency for people to associate with similar individuals. A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25\% (95\% confidence interval 1\% to 57\%). Similar effects are seen in coresident spouses (8\%, 0.2\% to 16\%), siblings who live within a mile (14\%, 1\% to 28\%), and next door neighbours (34\%, 7\% to 70\%). Effects are not seen between coworkers. The effect decays with time and with geographical separation.
Conclusions People’s happiness depends on the happiness of others with whom they are connected. This provides further justification for seeing happiness, like health, as a collective phenomenon.},

	abstract = {The article explores the evolution of Western political freedom from the Renaissance and Reformation to the present day. The author argues that freedom is not a static concept but evolves through distinct historical stages. Each stage is characterized by a different understanding of freedom, authority, and order. The Renaissance and Reformation marked a transition from a system of multiple authorities to a single, centralized authority. The Enlightenment period, marked by the rise of absolutism, saw the emergence of a more generalized concept of freedom, with the state playing a dominant role. The revolutionary period, beginning in the mid-eighteenth century, witnessed the transition from freedom as a subordinate to a dominant value. The twentieth century, characterized by the rise of democracy and the clash between individual and collective freedoms, saw the demise of a unified conception of freedom. The author concludes that in the contemporary era, freedom is a dimension of human thought and action, with its character and extent dependent on the particular processes in which it is engaged. – AI-generated abstract},

Why do patients remember long medical procedures as less painful than short ones? Why do home sellers demand prices they wouldn't dream of paying if they were home buyers? Why does the line at the grocery store always slow down when we join it? In this book, Harvard psychologist Gilbert describes the foibles of imagination and illusions of foresight that cause each of us to misconceive our tomorrows and misestimate our satisfactions. Using the latest research in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, philosophy, and behavioral economics, Gilbert reveals what we have discovered about the uniquely human ability to imagine the future, our capacity to predict how much we will like it when we get there, and why we seem to know so little about the hearts and minds of the people we are about to become.

	abstract = {This document explains how to adjust research findings for "replicability" or internal validity, specifically focusing on deworming studies. When evaluating charitable programs, researchers must account for the fact that studies may not perfectly replicate or capture true program effects. The case of deworming is particularly challenging due to limited high-quality evidence, unclear impact mechanisms, and unexpectedly large effect sizes (approximately 10\% income increase). These factors suggest the need to substantially discount the estimated effects. While various methods have been used to calculate deworming replicability adjustments, each has both strengths and significant limitations. Based on these considerations, an appropriate replicability adjustment for deworming studies would likely fall between 5-30\% (meaning a 70-95\% discount), with the specific percentage depending on various judgmental factors. In 2019, a replicability adjustment of approximately 13\% was recommended for deworming studies.},

Now, as mindfulness and other brands of meditation become ever more popular, promising to fix everything from our weight to our relationship to our professional career, these two bestselling authors sweep away the misconceptions around these practices and show how smart practice can change our personal traits and even our genome for the better. Drawing on cutting-edge research, Goleman and Davidson expertly reveal what we can learn from a one-of-a-kind data pool that includes world-class meditators. They share for the first time remarkable findings that show how meditation - without drugs or high expense - can cultivate qualities such as selflessness, equanimity, love and compassion, and redesign our neural circuitry. Demonstrating two master thinkers at work, The Science of Meditation explains precisely how mind training benefits us. More than daily doses or sheer hours, we need smart practice, including crucial ingredients such as targeted feedback from a master teacher and a more spacious worldview. Gripping in its storytelling and based on a lifetime of thought and action, this is one of those rare books that has the power to change us at the deepest level},

To counsel people appropriately, clinicians need to know what the evidence says about the health benefits of meditation.To determine the efficacy of meditation programs in improving stress-related outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress/distress, positive mood, mental health–related quality of life, attention, substance use, eating habits, sleep, pain, and weight) in diverse adult clinical populations.We identified randomized clinical trials with active controls for placebo effects through November 2012 from {MEDLINE}, {PsycINFO}, {EMBASE}, {PsycArticles}, Scopus, {CINAHL}, {AMED}, the Cochrane Library, and hand searches. Two independent reviewers screened citations and extracted data. We graded the strength of evidence using 4 domains (risk of bias, precision, directness, and consistency) and determined the magnitude and direction of effect by calculating the relative difference between groups in change from baseline. When possible, we conducted meta-analyses using standardized mean differences to obtain aggregate estimates of effect size with 95\% confidence intervals.After reviewing 18 753 citations, we included 47 trials with 3515 participants. Mindfulness meditation programs had moderate evidence of improved anxiety (effect size, 0.38 [95\% {CI}, 0.12-0.64] at 8 weeks and 0.22 [0.02-0.43] at 3-6 months), depression (0.30 [0.00-0.59] at 8 weeks and 0.23 [0.05-0.42] at 3-6 months), and pain (0.33 [0.03- 0.62]) and low evidence of improved stress/distress and mental health–related quality of life. We found low evidence of no effect or insufficient evidence of any effect of meditation programs on positive mood, attention, substance use, eating habits, sleep, and weight. We found no evidence that meditation programs were better than any active treatment (ie, drugs, exercise, and other behavioral therapies).Clinicians should be aware that meditation programs can result in small to moderate reductions of multiple negative dimensions of psychological stress. Thus, clinicians should be prepared to talk with their patients about the role that a meditation program could have in addressing psychological stress. Stronger study designs are needed to determine the effects of meditation programs in improving the positive dimensions of mental health and stress-related behavior.},

In Experiment 1, a longitudinal field experiment in a fundraising organization, callers in an intervention group briefly interacted with a beneficiary; callers in two control groups read a letter from the beneficiary and discussed it amongst themselves or had no exposure to him. One month later, the intervention group displayed significantly greater persistence and job performance than the control groups. The intervention group increased significantly in persistence (142\% more phone time) and job performance (171\% more money raised); the control groups did not. Experiments 2 and 3 used a laboratory editing task to examine mediating mechanisms and boundary conditions. In Experiment 2, respectful contact with beneficiaries increased persistence, mediated by perceived impact. In Experiment 3, mere contact with beneficiaries and task significance interacted to increase persistence, mediated by affective commitment to beneficiaries.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent {MM}- {GBSA} calculations. Using the best {RMSD} among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate ({RMSD} ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide {SP} settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta {FlexPepDock} method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

How can we originate new ideas, policies, and practices without risking it all?

Learn from an entrepreneur who pitches his start-ups by highlighting the reasons not to invest, a woman at Apple who challenged Steve Jobs from three levels below, an analyst who overturned the rule of secrecy at the CIA, a billionaire financial wizard who fires employees for failing to criticize him, and a TV executive who didn’t even work in comedy but saved Seinfeld from the cutting-room floor.

While it is commonly believed that intelligence implies rationality, research shows that rationality is not strongly correlated with intelligence. This is because rationality involves the ability to engage in reflective thought, to step back from one’s own thinking and correct its faulty tendencies. Intelligence, on the other hand, is more closely associated with raw intellectual horsepower, such as abstract reasoning and verbal ability. There is some evidence that rationality can be improved through training, suggesting that it is a skill that can be developed.  – AI-generated abstract},

We seek out information that supports us and downplay information that doesn’t. We get distracted by short-term emotions. When it comes to making choices, it seems, our brains are flawed instruments. Unfortunately, merely being aware of these shortcomings doesn’t fix the problem, any more than knowing that we are nearsighted helps us to see. The real question is: How can we do better?

   In Decisive, the Heaths, based on an exhaustive study of the decision-making literature, introduce a four-step process designed to counteract these biases. Written in an engaging and compulsively readable style, Decisive takes readers on an unforgettable journey, from a rock star’s ingenious decision-making trick to a CEO’s disastrous acquisition, to a single question that can often resolve thorny personal decisions.

   Along the way, we learn the answers to critical questions like these: How can we stop the cycle of agonizing over our decisions? How can we make group decisions without destructive politics? And how can we ensure that we don’t overlook precious opportunities to change our course?

   Decisive is the Heath brothers’ most powerful—and important—book yet, offering fresh strategies and practical tools enabling us to make better choices. Because the right decision, at the right moment, can make all the difference.},

This approach is indirect and can be slow. We propose a new general framework for directly extracting a policy from data, as if it were obtained by reinforcement learning following inverse reinforcement learning. We show that a certain instantiation of our framework draws an analogy between imitation learning and generative adversarial networks, from which we derive a model-free imitation learning algorithm that obtains significant performance gains over existing model-free methods in imitating complex behaviors in large, high-dimensional environments.},

Using a dataset of over 200 language model evaluations on Wikitext and Penn Treebank spanning 2012-2023, we find that the compute required to reach a set performance threshold has halved approximately every 8 months, with a 95\% confidence interval of around 5 to 14 months, substantially faster than hardware gains per Moore's Law. We estimate augmented scaling laws, which enable us to quantify algorithmic progress and determine the relative contributions of scaling models versus innovations in training algorithms. Despite the rapid pace of algorithmic progress and the development of new architectures such as the transformer, our analysis reveals that the increase in compute made an even larger contribution to overall performance improvements over this time period. Though limited by noisy benchmark data, our analysis quantifies the rapid progress in language modeling, shedding light on the relative contributions from compute and algorithms.},

	abstract = {We investigate the optimal model size and number of tokens for training a transformer language model under a given compute budget. We find that current large language models are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4 times more more data. Chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms Gopher (280B), {GPT}-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing {NLG} (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that Chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5\% on the {MMLU} benchmark, greater than a 7\% improvement over Gopher.},

While these groups were often disparaged as being artificial and illegitimate expressions of public opinion, they were nonetheless instrumental in shaping legislation on a wide range of issues, including slavery, land reform, and education. The book examines the relationship of pressure groups to the evolving concept of ‘the people’ in early Victorian politics and explores how they operated and achieved their goals. Their success was largely dependent upon the ability of their leaders to co-opt and organize different segments of the population, to cultivate the support of sympathetic MPs, and to generate public opinion through a variety of tactics, such as public meetings, petitioning, and the press. The essays in this collection examine the tactics, strategies, and impact of a number of pressure groups involved in campaigns to address a range of issues that were at the forefront of Victorian social and political consciousness. – AI-generated abstract},

Drawing on stories of her own practice, Jacobs Hendel sheds light on the core emotions (anger, fear, sadness, joy) and inhibitory emotions (anxiety, shame), how they manifest in the body, and how by employing "accelerated experiential dynamic psychotherapy" ({AEDP}) we can return to mental wellbeing.

The compute needed to train these models can only be attained using many coordinated machines that are communicating data between them.

The current study used meta-analysis to estimate the population correlation between pay level and measures of pay and job satisfaction. Cumulating across 115 correlations from 92 independent samples, results suggested that pay level was correlated .15 with job satisfaction and .23 with pay satisfaction. Various moderators of the relationship were investigated. Despite the popular theorizing, results suggest that pay level is only marginally related to satisfaction.

	abstract = {Recent research has begun to distinguish two aspects of subjective well-being. Emotional well-being refers to the emotional quality of an individual's everyday experience--the frequency and intensity of experiences of joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection that make one's life pleasant or unpleasant. Life evaluation refers to the thoughts that people have about their life when they think about it. We raise the question of whether money buys happiness, separately for these two aspects of well-being. We report an analysis of more than 450,000 responses to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily survey of 1,000 {US} residents conducted by the Gallup Organization. We find that emotional well-being (measured by questions about emotional experiences yesterday) and life evaluation (measured by Cantril's Self-Anchoring Scale) have different correlates. Income and education are more closely related to life evaluation, but health, care giving, loneliness, and smoking are relatively stronger predictors of daily emotions. When plotted against log income, life evaluation rises steadily. Emotional well-being also rises with log income, but there is no further progress beyond an annual income of \$75,000. Low income exacerbates the emotional pain associated with such misfortunes as divorce, ill health, and being alone. We conclude that high income buys life satisfaction but not happiness, and that low income is associated both with low life evaluation and low emotional well-being.},

This article reviews research from a variety of fields, including behavioral genetics, neuroscience, and psychology, to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay of factors that contribute to greatness.  While deliberate practice and talent are both important, they are neither sufficient nor necessary for achieving greatness. Instead, greatness emerges from a confluence of factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental influences,  motivation, opportunity, and luck. The author argues that the pursuit of a singular explanation for greatness is misleading and that a more holistic approach that considers the complex interactions of various factors is needed to fully understand the emergence of excellence. – AI-generated abstract},

                  plateaued. Using experience sampling with a continuous scale,

                  e2016976118 (2021)] reported a linear-log pattern in which
                  average happiness rose consistently with log(income). We
                  engaged in an adversarial collaboration to search for a
                  coherent interpretation of both studies. A reanalysis of
                  Killingsworth’s experienced sampling data confirmed the

                  increases steadily with log(income) among happier people, and

                  nonlinearities contribute to the overall linear-log

                  because of a ceiling effect. The authors of both studies
                  failed to anticipate that increased income is associated with
                  systematic changes in the shape of the happiness distribution.
                  The mislabeling of the dependent variable and the incorrect
                  assumption of homogeneity were consequences of practices that

Written by leading experts from both disciplines, The Handbook of Rationality covers the main normative and descriptive theories of rationality--how people ought to think, how they actually think, and why we often deviate from what we can call rational. It also offers insights from other fields such as artificial intelligence, economics, the social sciences, and cognitive neuroscience. The Handbook proposes a novel classification system for researchers in human rationality, and it creates new connections between rationality research in philosophy, psychology, and other disciplines. Following the basic distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, the book first considers the theoretical side, including normative and descriptive theories of logical, probabilistic, causal, and defeasible reasoning. It then turns to the practical side, discussing topics such as decision making, bounded rationality, game theory, deontic and legal reasoning, and the relation between rationality and morality. Finally, it covers topics that arise in both theoretical and practical rationality, including visual and spatial thinking, scientific rationality, how children learn to reason rationally, and the connection between intelligence and rationality.},

                  science. A field that might benefit from such an approach is
                  artificial intelligence ({AI}) research, where the number of
                  scientific publications has been growing exponentially over
                  the last years, making it challenging for human researchers to
                  keep track of the progress. Here, we use {AI} techniques to

                  develop a new graph-based benchmark based on real-world data

To quantify the capabilities of {AI} systems in terms of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: 50\%-task-completion time horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that {AI} models can complete with 50\% success rate. We first timed humans with relevant domain expertise on a combination of {RE}-Bench, {HCAST}, and 66 novel shorter tasks. On these tasks, current frontier {AI} models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet have a 50\% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier {AI} time horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in {AI} models' time horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use capabilities. We discuss the limitations of our results -- including their degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, {AI} systems will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a month.},

The median tenure for men was 4.3 years, while the median for women was 3.8 years. Median tenure was generally higher among older workers than younger ones, and longer tenures were more common among Whites than other racial and ethnic groups. Younger workers were more likely to have shorter tenures than older workers, and those with less than a high school diploma had lower median tenure than those with more education. Workers in the public sector had a higher median tenure than those in the private sector, reflecting, in part, differences in age distribution. Among major private industries, manufacturing had the highest median tenure, while leisure and hospitality had the lowest. Management, professional, and related occupations had the highest median tenure, while service occupations had the lowest.  – AI-generated abstract},

But what does it tell us when a good semblance of a behaviour can be achieved using cheap tricks that seem to have little to do with what we intuitively imagine intelligence to be? Are these intuitions wrong, and is intelligence really just a bag of tricks? Or are the philosophers right, and is a behavioural understanding of intelligence simply too weak? I think both of these are wrong. I suggest in the context of question- answering that what matters when it comes to the science of AI is not a good semblance of intelligent behaviour at all, but the behaviour itself, what it depends on, and how it can be achieved.

	abstract = {As the current recession ends, many workers will not be returning to the jobs they once held—those jobs are gone. In The New Division of Labor, Frank Levy and Richard Murnane show how computers are changing the employment landscape and how the right kinds of education can ease the transition to the new job market.
The book tells stories of people at work—a high-end financial advisor, a customer service representative, a pair of successful chefs, a cardiologist, an automotive mechanic, the author Victor Hugo, floor traders in a London financial exchange. The authors merge these stories with insights from cognitive science, computer science, and economics to show how computers are enhancing productivity in many jobs even as they eliminate other jobs—both directly and by sending work offshore. At greatest risk are jobs that can be expressed in programmable rules—blue collar, clerical, and similar work that requires moderate skills and used to pay middle-class wages. The loss of these jobs leaves a growing division between those who can and cannot earn a good living in the computerized economy. Left unchecked, the division threatens the nation’s democratic institutions.
The nation’s challenge is to recognize this division and to prepare the population for the high-wage/high-skilled jobs that are rapidly growing in number—jobs involving extensive problem solving and interpersonal communication. Using detailed examples—a second grade classroom, an IBM managerial training program, Cisco Networking Academies—the authors describe how these skills can be taught and how our adjustment to the computerized workplace can begin in earnest.},

He argues that this approach is more precise and avoids the ambiguity inherent in comparative language. For example, two people might agree that forecasting is underrated, but they may be disagreeing on how good forecasting is and on how other people rate it. The author concedes that direct assessments are more difficult to formulate and require more effort, but ultimately yield a more concrete and nuanced understanding of the topic at hand. – AI-generated abstract.},

These developments include updates toward shorter timelines for artificial general intelligence (AGI), the likely Trump presidency, the emergence of the o1 (inference-time compute scaling) paradigm, Deepseek's achievements, massive AI datacenter investments, increased internal deployment of AI systems, and the absence of existential risk considerations in mainstream AI discourse. These changes render many existing AI governance approaches obsolete and suggest we are entering a critical period. The US advantage over China in AI development appears smaller than previously assumed, questioning strategies built on maintaining technological superiority. The situation demands new priorities, including increased focus on right-leaning communications, deeper engagement with the Trump administration, and development of policy proposals aligned with Republican interests. While some traditional approaches like EU/UK collaboration and compute governance remain relevant, their effectiveness may be diminished. The developments also highlight the growing importance of having safety-conscious researchers within leading AI labs, though the value of this approach is debated. These shifts occur against a backdrop of potentially very short timelines to AGI, adding urgency to strategic adjustments. - AI-generated abstract},

@collection{Locke2009HandbookOfPrinciples,
	abstract = {There is a strong movement today in management to encourage management practices based on research evidence. In the first volume of this handbook, I asked experts in 39 areas of management to identify a central principle that summarized and integrated the core findings from their specialty area and then to explain this principle and give real business examples of the principle in action. I asked them to write in non-technical terms, e.g., without a lot of statistics, and almost all did so.
The previous handbook proved to be quite popular, so I was asked to edit a second edition. This new edition has been expanded to 33 topics, and there are some new authors for the previously included topics. The new edition also includes: updated case examples, updated references and practical exercises at the end of each chapter. It also includes a preface on evidence-based management. The principles for the first edition were intended to be relatively timeless, so it is no surprise that most of the principles are the same (though some chapter titles include more than one principle).

This book could serve as a textbook in advanced undergraduate and in MBA courses. It could also be of use to practicing managers and not just those in Human Resource departments. Every practicing manager may not want to read the whole book, but I am willing to guarantee that every one will find at least one or more chapters that will be practically useful. In this time of economic crisis, the need for effective management practices is more acute than ever.},

The pedagogical approach transitions from an intuitive understanding through Venn diagrams to formal game theory notation, making the concept accessible while maintaining mathematical rigor.

Cipriani and colleagues are admirably clear about the limitations of included studies. They rated 82\% as having moderate to high risk of bias. They also noted specific biases such as a novelty effect, whereby a medication looked significantly better when evaluated as the novel comparator in a trial than when as the older or control comparator. In addition, 78\% of studies were funded by drug companies, and many other studies failed to report funding at all.

	abstract = {This paper has a critical and a constructive part. The first
                  part formulates a political demand, based on ethical
                  considerations: Until 2050, there should be a global
                  moratorium on synthetic phenomenology, strictly banning all
                  research that directly aims at or knowingly risks the
                  emergence of artificial consciousness on post-biotic carrier
                  systems. The second part lays the first conceptual foundations
                  for an open-ended process with the aim of gradually refining
                  the original moratorium, tying it to an ever more
                  fine-grained, rational, evidence-based, and hopefully
                  ethically convincing set of constraints. The systematic
                  research program defined by this process could lead to an
                  incremental reformulation of the original moratorium. It might
                  result in a moratorium repeal even before 2050, in the
                  continuation of a strict ban beyond the year 2050, or a
                  gradually evolving, more substantial, and ethically refined
                  view of which — if any — kinds of conscious experience we want

This framework introduces levels of {AGI} performance, generality, and autonomy, providing a common language to compare models, assess risks, and measure progress along the path to {AGI}. To develop our framework, we analyze existing definitions of {AGI}, and distill six principles that a useful ontology for {AGI} should satisfy. With these principles in mind, we propose "Levels of {AGI}" based on depth (performance) and breadth (generality) of capabilities, and reflect on how current systems fit into this ontology. We discuss the challenging requirements for future benchmarks that quantify the behavior and capabilities of {AGI} models against these levels. Finally, we discuss how these levels of {AGI} interact with deployment considerations such as autonomy and risk, and emphasize the importance of carefully selecting Human-{AI} Interaction paradigms for responsible and safe deployment of highly capable {AI} systems.},

	abstract = {Human beings have the unique ability to view the world in a detached way: We can think about the world in terms that transcend our own experience or interest, and consider the world from a vantage point that is, in Nagel's words, "nowhere in particular". At the same time, each of us is a particular person in a particular place, each with his own "personal" view of the world, a view that we can recognize as just one aspect of the whole. How do we reconcile these two standpoints--intellectually, morally, and practically? To what extent are they irreconcilable and to what extent can they be integrated? Thomas Nagel's ambitious and lively book tackles this fundamental issue, arguing that our divided nature is the root of a whole range of philosophical problems, touching, as it does, every aspect of human life. He deals with its manifestations in such fields of philosophy as: the mind-body problem, personal identity, knowledge and skepticism, thought and reality, free will, ethics, the relation between moral and other values, the meaning of life, and death. Excessive objectification has been a malady of recent analytic philosophy, claims Nagel, it has led to implausible forms of reductionism in the philosophy of mind and elsewhere. The solution is not to inhibit the objectifying impulse, but to insist that it learn to live alongside the internal perspectives that cannot be either discarded or objectified. Reconciliation between the two standpoints, in the end, is not always possible.},

@book{Nagel1991EqualityPartiality,
	abstract = {This essay explores the central problem of political theory: reconciling the standpoint of the collectivity with the standpoint of the individual. It begins by arguing that the ethical basis of political theory stems from a division within each individual between the personal and impersonal standpoints. The former represents individual desires, interests, and projects, while the latter represents the claims of the collectivity, producing a powerful demand for universal impartiality and equality. The author argues that the search for a political ideal requires an acceptable integration of these two standpoints, noting that the problem of designing institutions that do justice to the equal importance of all persons without making unacceptable demands on individuals has not been solved. The essay goes on to consider the problem of utopianism, arguing that a political theory is Utopian in the pejorative sense if it describes a form of collective life that humans could not lead through any feasible process of social and mental development. A non-utopian solution requires a proper balance between the ideal and persuasive functions of political theory, demanding both impersonal and personal justification. The author explores the concept of political legitimacy, arguing that its ideal is that the use of state power should be capable of being authorized by each citizen, ultimately requiring unanimous agreement on basic principles and institutions. The essay concludes that a harmonious combination of an acceptable political ideal and acceptable standards of personal morality is difficult to achieve, arguing that the problem of designing institutions that do justice to the equal importance of all persons without making unacceptable demands on individuals remains unsolved. – AI-generated abstract.},

	langid = {english},
	abstract = {People often ask me for career advice related to {AGI} safety. This post (now also translated into Spanish) summarizes the advice I most commonly give. I’ve split it into three sections: general mindset, alignment research and governance work. For each of the latter two, I start with high-level advice aimed primarily at students and those early in their careers, then dig into more details of the field. See also this post I wrote two years ago, containing a bunch of fairly general career advice.General {mindsetIn} order to have a big impact on the world you need to find a big lever. This document assumes that you think, as I do, that {AGI} safety is the biggest such lever. There are many ways to pull on that lever, though—from research and engineering to operations and field-building to politics and communications. I encourage you to choose between these based primarily on your personal fit—a combination of what you're really good at and what you really enjoy. In my opinion the difference between being a great versus a mediocre fit swamps other differences in the impactfulness of most pairs of {AGI}-safety-related jobs.How should you find your personal fit? To start, you should focus on finding work where you can get fast feedback loops. That will typically involve getting hands-on or doing some kind of concrete project (rather than just reading and learning) and seeing how quickly you can make progress. Eventually, once you've had a bunch of experience, you might notice a feeling of confusion or frustration: why is everyone else missing the point, or doing so badly at this? (Though note that a few top researchers commented on a draft to say that they didn't have this experience.) For some people that involves investigating a specific topic (for me, the question “what’s the best argument that {AGI} will be misaligned?“); for others it's about applying skills like conscientiousness (e.g. "why can't others just go through all the obvious steps?") Being excellent seldom feels like you’re excellent, because your own abilities set your baseline for what feels normal.What if you have that experience for something you don't enjoy doing? I expect that this is fairly rare, because being good at something is often very enjoyable. But in those cases, I'd suggest trying it until you observe that even a string of successes doesn't make you excited about what you're doing; and at that point, probably trying to pivot (although this is pretty dependent on the specific details).Lastly: {AGI} safety is a young and small field; there’s a lot to be done, and still very few people to do it. I encourage you to have agency when it comes to making things happen: most of the time the answer to “why isn’t this seemingly-good thing happening?” or “why aren’t we 10x better at this particular thing?” is “because nobody’s gotten around to it yet”. And the most important qualifications for being able to solve a problem are typically the ability to notice it},

	abstract = {Deep learning has revolutionized artificial intelligence over the past decade, achieving unprecedented capabilities across multiple domains. Three key observations emerge from examining this progress: First, AI systems have made dramatic advances in tasks ranging from image generation and game playing to language processing and scientific discovery, to the point where specifying tasks beyond AI capabilities has become increasingly difficult. Second, these improvements stem primarily from scaling up simple algorithms rather than developing deeper theoretical understanding. Third, while most experts failed to anticipate this rapid progress, those who did correctly forecast it often also warn about existential risks from artificial general intelligence. The evidence spans multiple domains: In computer vision, models progressed from generating basic shapes to photorealistic images and videos. In games, AI advanced from simple Atari games to complex strategy games requiring long-term planning. Language models developed sophisticated reasoning and coding abilities. In science, AI systems achieved breakthroughs in protein folding and mathematical proofs. This progress has been driven by exponential increases in computational resources, with modern systems using millions of times more compute than a decade ago. - AI-generated abstract

Direct public funding, which accounts for roughly 7\% of arts support, flows through federal, state, and local agencies, with the National Endowment for the Arts serving as the largest single funder. More significant are indirect funding streams through tax incentives that encourage private giving from individuals, foundations, and corporations. In 2011, Americans donated approximately \$13 billion to arts and cultural organizations, with individual donors accounting for about three-quarters of all charitable giving. The U.S. system differs from more centralized European models by emphasizing decentralization, diversity of funding sources, and entrepreneurial approaches. This decentralized structure, while sometimes challenging to navigate, has fostered significant growth in arts organizations and participation over the past 40 years. Tax policies play a crucial role by incentivizing private support, with estimates suggesting that for every dollar of foregone tax revenue, donors contribute an additional \$0.80-\$1.30 to arts organizations. The system's flexibility and reliance on both public and private support has helped create a rich artistic landscape while allowing regional and local communities to maintain their cultural distinctiveness. - AI-generated abstract},

However, the risk of nuclear war has increased due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a potential new arms race. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed weaknesses in global institutions and preparedness, but also spurred innovation in vaccine development. Further, there has been a significant increase in the public's awareness of the dangers of advanced AI, leading to a shift in government policy and an emphasis on regulating AI development. While the overall picture of existential risk is complex, with some risks increasing and others decreasing, there is a growing awareness of the dangers and a developing movement to address these risks.},

Whether advancing progress is ultimately good or bad depends crucially on whether it also advances the end of humanity. Because we know so little about the answer to this crucial question, the case for advancing progress is undermined. I suggest we must either overcome this objection through improving our understanding of these connections between progress and human extinction or switch our focus to advancing certain kinds of progress relative to others — changing where we are going, rather than just how soon we get there.},

@online{Organization2023Schistosomiasis,
	abstract = {This comprehensive overview examines schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma that affects over 251.4 million people worldwide. The disease, transmitted through contact with infested water containing larval forms released by freshwater snails, exists in both intestinal and urogenital forms caused by five main species. Predominantly affecting poor and rural communities in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in Africa, schistosomiasis causes symptoms ranging from abdominal pain and blood in urine to severe complications including organ damage and cancer. While rarely fatal, the disease significantly impacts quality of life, causing anemia, stunting, and learning difficulties in children, and potentially leading to infertility and chronic health issues in adults. Control strategies focus on large-scale treatment with praziquantel, alongside improving sanitation, water access, and snail control. Despite successful control programs in several countries, challenges persist, including limited drug availability and treatment coverage, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The WHO coordinates preventive chemotherapy strategies and works with partners to increase access to treatment, aiming for disease elimination as a public health problem and transmission interruption in selected countries by 2030. - AI-generated abstract},

@book{Oshinsky2005PolioAmericanStory,
	abstract = {Here is a remarkable portrait of America in the early 1950s, using the widespread panic over polio to shed light on our national obsessions and fears. Drawing on newly available papers of Jonas Salk, Albert Sabin and other key players, Oshinsky paints a suspenseful portrait of the race for the cure, weaving a dramatic tale centered on the furious rivalry between Salk and Sabin. Indeed, the competition was marked by a deep-seated ill will among the researchers that remained with them until their deaths. The author also tells the story of Isabel Morgan, perhaps the most talented of all polio researchers, who might have beaten Salk to the prize if she had not retired to raise a family. As backdrop to this feverish research, Oshinsky offers an insightful look at the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which was founded in the 1930s by FDR and Basil O'Connor. The National Foundation revolutionized fundraising and the perception of disease in America, using "poster children" and the famous March of Dimes to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from a vast army of contributors (instead of a few well-heeled benefactors), creating the largest research and rehabilitation network in the history of medicine. The polio experience also revolutionized the way in which the government licensed and tested new drugs before allowing them on the market, and the way in which the legal system dealt with manufacturers' liability for unsafe products. Finally, and perhaps most tellingly, Oshinsky reveals that polio was never the raging epidemic portrayed by the media, but in truth a relatively uncommon disease. But in baby-booming America--increasingly suburban, family-oriented, and hygiene-obsessed--the spectre of polio, like the spectre of the atomic bomb, soon became a cloud of terror over daily life.},

High impact years began around 1955 and calculations are loosely based on 1 life saved per 2.7 units of blood transfused. In the USA alone an estimated 4.5 million lives are saved each year. From these data I determined that 1.5\% of the population was saved annually by blood transfusions and I applied this percentage on population data from 1950-2008 for North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Asia and Africa. This rate may inflate the effectiveness of transfusions in the early decades but excludes the developing world entirely. Since the late 1980s blood donations have declined and the surplus will soon end. Call this efficiency, but there’s also a risk of future transfusion demands not being met.},

Why is so much writing so bad, and how can we make it better? Is the English language being corrupted by texting and social media? Do the kids today even care about good writing? Why should any of us care? In The Sense of Style, the bestselling linguist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker answers these questions and more. Rethinking the usage guide for the twenty-first century, Pinker doesn’t carp about the decline of language or recycle pet peeves from the rulebooks of a century ago. Instead, he applies insights from the sciences of language and mind to the challenge of crafting clear, coherent, and stylish prose. In this short, cheerful, and eminently practical book, Pinker shows how writing depends on imagination, empathy, coherence, grammatical knowhow, and an ability to savor and reverse engineer the good prose of others. He replaces dogma about usage with reason and evidence, allowing writers and editors to apply the guidelines judiciously, rather than robotically, being mindful of what they are designed to accomplish. Filled with examples of great and gruesome prose, Pinker shows us how the art of writing can be a form of pleasurable mastery and a fascinating intellectual topic in its own right.},

Notably, participants were more likely to judge AI-generated poems as human-authored than actual human-authored poems (χ2(2, N = 16,340) = 247.04, p < 0.0001). We found that AI-generated poems were rated more favorably in qualities such as rhythm and beauty, and that this contributed to their mistaken identification as human-authored. Our findings suggest that participants employed shared yet flawed heuristics to differentiate AI from human poetry: the simplicity of AI-generated poems may be easier for non-experts to understand, leading them to prefer AI-generated poetry and misinterpret the complexity of human poems as incoherence generated by AI.},

	abstract = {This interview examines China's AI capabilities, governance approaches, and potential for cooperation with Western nations on AI safety. While Chinese AI currently lags 1.5-2 years behind Western capabilities in large language models, China leads in certain domains like computer vision and surveillance technology. The primary bottleneck for Chinese AI development is computational power, largely due to US semiconductor export controls limiting access to advanced chips. Although China is investing heavily in indigenizing its semiconductor supply chain, significant technical and economic challenges remain. Chinese AI regulation focuses primarily on information control rather than safety, though recent policy developments suggest growing attention to AI risks. The Chinese governance landscape is complex, with multiple competing agencies lacking clear hierarchical organization. Despite these challenges, opportunities exist for US-China cooperation on AI governance through mechanisms like track two dialogues and harmonized safety standards. The analysis emphasizes that rather than viewing China as a unitary actor, understanding the complex interplay between national and local policies, competing institutions, and evolving priorities is crucial for effective international coordination on AI development and safety. - AI-generated abstract},

	abstract = {The current AI paradigm based on large language models (LLMs) is approaching a plateau in capabilities that will not lead to artificial general intelligence (AGI). While LLMs will continue to improve, these improvements will face steep diminishing returns and decouple from the intuitive metric of "getting generally smarter." Recent models like Grok 3 and GPT-4.5 confirm this trend with minimal improvements over predecessors. LLMs excel only at eisegesis-friendly problems (where humans do the work of making their outputs useful) and in-distribution problems (tasks similar to their training data). They lack true agency and struggle to maintain focus across long inferential distances. Despite impressive benchmarks, real-world application reveals their limitations. By the 2030s, LLMs will be deeply integrated into the economy as useful tools, but will not achieve autonomous general intelligence or replace broad-scope human labor. However, at some unknown point—likely in the 2030s—someone will develop a different approach to AI, potentially leading to transformative consequences. Until then, AI progress will be characterized by incremental improvements masking fundamental limitations, with hype consistently outpacing actual capabilities. – AI-generated abstract.},

In this paper, we show that {LMs} can teach themselves to use external tools via simple {APIs} and achieve the best of both worlds. We introduce Toolformer, a model trained to decide which {APIs} to call, when to call them, what arguments to pass, and how to best incorporate the results into future token prediction. This is done in a self-supervised way, requiring nothing more than a handful of demonstrations for each {API}. We incorporate a range of tools, including a calculator, a Q\&A system, two different search engines, a translation system, and a calendar. Toolformer achieves substantially improved zero-shot performance across a variety of downstream tasks, often competitive with much larger models, without sacrificing its core language modeling abilities.},

On the other hand, China is intensifying its domestic investments in more advanced chips while also reducing market shares of U.S. firms—and by extension, the revenues U.S. firms need to invest in the next-generation of technology. Over time, this loss of market share could well undermine the competitiveness of U.S. firms in this key industry.

	abstract = {This article examines, in four sections, the substantial literature on the longitudinal connection between personal age and outstanding achievement in domains of creativity and leadership. First, the key empirical findings are surveyed, with special focus on the typical age curve and its variations across disciplines, the association between precocity, longevity, and production rate, and the linkage between quantity and quality of output over the course of a career. Second, the central methodological issues are outlined, such as the compositional fallacy and differential competition, in order to appraise the relative presence of fact and artifact in the reported results. Third, the more important theoretical interpretations of the longitudinal data are presented and then evaluated for explanatory and predictive power. Fourth and last, central empirical, methodological, and theoretical considerations lead to a set of critical questions on which future research should likely concentrate.

Proceeding from simple, small-scale societies, the author develops a distinctive theory of political obligation in an ideal democracy; and after discussing various forms of disobedience, including conscientious objection, the author asks to what extent existing systems of government approximate to this ideal.},

The author presents evidence that success can be achieved at different ages across diverse domains, citing examples of athletes, scientists, artists, and business leaders who accomplished their most notable work at both young and older ages. While acknowledging that certain fields, such as athletics and executive leadership, may have age-related limitations, the article emphasizes the potential for individuals to excel at any age, as supported by research on cognitive function, which suggests peak brain activity can persist into later life. The article ultimately promotes a view of achievement that is less focused on age-based expectations and more centered on continuous learning, collaboration, and adaptability across different age groups and professional backgrounds. – AI-generated abstract.},

We call an AI system “corrigible” if it cooperates with what its creators regard as a corrective intervention, despite default incentives for rational agents to resist attempts to shut them down or modify their preferences. We introduce the notion of corrigibility and analyze utility functions that attempt to make an agent shut down safely if a shutdown button is pressed, while avoiding incentives to prevent the button from being pressed or cause the button to be pressed, and while ensuring propagation of the shutdown behavior as it creates new subsystems or self-modifies. While some proposals are interesting, none have yet been demonstrated to satisfy all of our intuitive desiderata, leaving this simple problem in corrigibility wide-open.},

If so, why? Is there a difference between procrastination and prudence? What tricks do we play on ourselves when we procrastinate at work, school, and home? If visualizing our dreams isn't enough to make them real, then what steps do we need to take? Along the way, Dr. Steel dispels the myths and misunderstandings of motivation and procrastination, replacing them with a clear explanation of why we put off until tomorrow exactly what we should be doing today.

The path is particularly suitable for those with humanities research skills and interest in China, with opportunities available through scholarships, language study, policy positions, and work in relevant organizations.

	abstract = {This article examines the potential for significant variation in the effectiveness of solutions to social problems. The article argues that the best solutions within a given area often achieve considerably greater impact per unit of effort compared to the average solution. Several studies are reviewed that demonstrate this pattern across a variety of fields, including global health, education, and climate change. The article explores reasons for this variation, including the lack of strong feedback loops between impact and resource allocation, the potential for regression to the mean in effectiveness estimates, and the possibility that the best solutions are simply not well-measured or documented. The article advocates for a "hits-based" approach to finding solutions, prioritizing those with high potential upside even if they carry a higher risk of failure. Several frameworks and methodologies are discussed for identifying promising solutions, including upside/downside analysis, importance-neglectedness-tractability analysis, and bottleneck analysis. – AI-generated abstract},

The likelihood of offering health insurance increases with organizational budget size, with 100\% of large organizations offering health insurance. 31.6\% of organizations offer a bonus program, while 63.8\% of respondents provide dental insurance and 49\% provide vision insurance. The most popular retirement plans are 401(k) plans and 403(b) plans.

A subset of superforecasters, Samotsvety, provided more near-term estimations (~28\% by 2030), but their focus on AI introduces selection bias.

Larger base models pretrained on massive datasets, combined with reinforcement learning techniques, have enabled models to achieve expert-level performance on scientific reasoning, coding, and other specialized tasks.  Furthermore, increasing test-time compute allows models to “think” longer, leading to improved accuracy, while the development of agent scaffolding enables them to complete complex, multi-step projects. Extrapolating current trends suggests that by 2028, AI systems could surpass human capabilities in various domains, potentially accelerating research in fields like AI, software engineering, and scientific discovery.  However, challenges remain in applying AI to ill-defined, high-context tasks and long-term projects.  Growth in computational power and the AI research workforce are also expected to encounter bottlenecks around 2030, suggesting that transformative AI will either emerge by that time or progress will slow considerably, making the next five years crucial for the field. – AI-generated abstract.},

	abstract = {Objective: People struggle to act on the goals that they set themselves, and this gap between intention and action is likely to be exacerbated by mental health problems. Evidence suggests that forming specific if‐then plans (or ‘implementation intentions’) can promote goal attainment and a number of studies have applied such techniques in clinical contexts. However, to date, the extent to which planning can help people with mental health problems has not been systematically examined.Method: The present review used meta‐analysis to investigate the effect of if‐then planning on goal attainment among people with a DSM‐IV/ICD‐10 diagnosis (i.e., clinical samples) or scores above a relevant cut‐off on clinical measures (i.e., analogue samples). In total, 29 experimental studies, from 18 records, met the inclusion criteria.Results: Excluding one outlying (very large) effect, forming implementation intentions had a large‐sized effect on goal attainment (d+ = 0.99, k = 28, N = 1,636). Implementation intentions proved effective across different mental health problems and goals, and in studies with different methodological approaches.Conclusions: Taken together, the findings suggest that forming implementation intentions can be a useful strategy for helping people with mental health problems to achieve various goals and might be usefully integrated into existing treatment approaches. However, further studies are needed addressing a wider range of mental health problems. Practitioner points: This meta‐analysis suggests that prompting people with mental health problems to form if‐then plans (known as ‘implementation intentions’) specifying when, where, and how they will achieve their goals can be beneficial. The findings proved robust across a range of methodologies, samples, and focal goals, suggesting that forming implementation intentions can help people with a range of mental health problems to achieve a range of different goals. We provide guidance to researchers and practitioners in how to promote the formation of implementation intentions.},

Meta-analysis yielded a modest pooled drug/placebo response rate ratio (RR=1.22, 95\% CI 1.15–1.31), with little separation between antidepressant types. Findings were similar for response rate differences and corresponding number needed to treat (NNT): overall NNT=9; tricyclic antidepressants NNT=14 \&gt; serotonin reuptake inhibitors NNT=9 \&gt; other antidepressants NNT=8. Numbers needed to treat decreased with increasing age: children (NNT=21) \&gt; mixed ages (NNT=10) \&gt; adolescents (NNT=8)ConclusionsAntidepressants of all types showed limited efficacy in juvenile depression, but fluoxetine might be more effective, especially in adolescents. Studies in children and in severely depressed, hospitalised or suicidal juvenile patients are needed, and effective, safe and readily accessible treatments for juvenile depression are urgently required.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

	abstract = {Several techniques induce a tradeoff between compute spent on training and inference for machine learning models.  Modifying model parameters and training data size allows for a 0.7 order-of-magnitude reduction in inference compute by increasing training compute by 1.2 orders of magnitude.  Monte Carlo Tree Search allows trading 1.6 orders of magnitude in inference compute for one in training at low performance, with the tradeoff reversing at higher performance levels. Pruning reduces inference compute by an order of magnitude with a 0.7 order-of-magnitude increase in training. Repeated sampling with filtering in generative models allows saving one order of magnitude in training compute by increasing inference compute by 1.5.  Combining these techniques yields tradeoffs of two to three orders of magnitude.  Current large language models are optimized for low inference compute at the cost of higher training compute. Consequently, more capable, higher-inference compute versions of deployed models likely exist but aren't publicly available due to cost.  This has implications for AI governance, particularly model evaluation and safety research, as it suggests the potential for faster, smaller-scale AI progress using augmented models. – AI-generated abstract.},

Key provisions include oversight of foundation models through social responsibility reporting, human control requirements, and mechanisms balancing innovation with safety. The draft addresses issues of regulatory overlap with existing data protection frameworks, allocation of responsibilities across the AI value chain, and differential treatment of various AI actors. While sharing some common concerns with Western approaches around safety and transparency, the Chinese framework diverges in its more structured regulatory approach compared to the U.S.'s minimal regulation stance.

Key innovations include: the Polis platform for finding consensus across different viewpoints; quadratic voting to allocate resources more fairly; and allowing citizens to build alternative government websites that can replace official ones if they prove more effective. The government publishes most non-sensitive data through APIs, enabling civic technologists to create improved public services. Rather than fighting disinformation through censorship, Taiwan mobilizes volunteers to create viral "humor over rumor" content. These approaches have helped maintain public trust while increasing the administration's responsiveness to citizens.

	abstract = {This article presents a conversation between Nathan Labenz, an entrepreneur and AI scout, and host of The Cognitive Revolution podcast, and Rob Wiblin, head of research at 80,000 Hours. Labenz describes his experiences as part of OpenAI's red team that probed GPT-4, a powerful language model, before its public release. He initially expressed concerns about OpenAI's lack of attention to safety, but later found that the company had undertaken extensive efforts to address these concerns. He argues that OpenAI's leadership is among the most thoughtful and competent in the industry, recognizing the potential risks of advanced AI and advocating for reasonable regulations. Labenz, however, questions the wisdom of OpenAI's single-minded pursuit of general artificial intelligence (AGI) given the apparent disparity between rapid capability advancements and less developed safety measures.  He proposes that focusing on narrow, specialized AI applications could both yield significant benefits and provide more time to develop robust safety protocols for AGI. Labenz concludes by emphasizing the unique responsibility of AI researchers and developers, particularly those at OpenAI, to carefully consider the potential implications of their work and actively contribute to shaping the future of AI. – AI-generated abstract},

The author argues that the arrival of such a technology would lead to a dramatic acceleration of economic growth, with rates of output doubling every few months, driven by rapid self-replication of AI and robotic systems. This would lead to a massive expansion of physical capital and industrial output, eventually reaching natural resource limits.  The author then discusses a range of counterarguments from economists, including the Baumol effect, diminishing returns to intelligence, and the difficulty of manufacturing robots. He argues that these objections are based on mistaken heuristics and assumptions about the capabilities of AI. Finally, the author discusses the moral status of AI systems and the potential for AI to be exploited by humans or to become a force of domination. He argues that we should aim for a future of mutually beneficial coexistence with AI systems, but that this will require a careful consideration of AI welfare and the creation of institutions to prevent the abuse of AI systems. – AI-generated abstract},

He rejects the view that AI should be slowed down or paused, advocating instead for "defensive acceleration" – accelerating the development of technologies that enhance human resilience and defense against both physical and informational threats. Buterin identifies four categories of such defensive technologies: (1) macro physical defense, such as improved fortifications and resilience technologies like Starlink, (2) micro physical defense (biodefense), which includes advances in vaccine platforms, air purification technologies, and open-source pathogen detection systems, (3) cyberdefense, which involves improving cryptography and the ability to verify and authenticate online actors using zero-knowledge proofs, and (4) info defense, such as systems for identifying and mitigating misinformation using trustless mechanisms like Community Notes. Buterin argues that while AI can exacerbate existing geopolitical risks of centralized power, a decentralized approach to AI development and deployment, combined with these defensive technologies, could help to mitigate these risks and create a more resilient and equitable future. – AI-generated abstract},

However, there exist few evaluations for {AI} R\&D capabilities, and none that are highly realistic and have a direct comparison to human performance. We introduce {RE}-Bench (Research Engineering Benchmark, v1), which consists of 7 challenging, open-ended {ML} research engineering environments and data from 71 8-hour attempts by 61 distinct human experts. We confirm that our experts make progress in the environments given 8 hours, with 82\% of expert attempts achieving a non-zero score and 24\% matching or exceeding our strong reference solutions. We compare humans to several public frontier models through best-of-k with varying time budgets and agent designs, and find that the best {AI} agents achieve a score 4x higher than human experts when both are given a total time budget of 2 hours per environment. However, humans currently display better returns to increasing time budgets, narrowly exceeding the top {AI} agent scores given an 8-hour budget, and achieving 2x the score of the top {AI} agent when both are given 32 total hours (across different attempts). Qualitatively, we find that modern {AI} agents possess significant expertise in many {ML} topics -- e.g. an agent wrote a faster custom Triton kernel than any of our human experts' -- and can generate and test solutions over ten times faster than humans, at much lower cost. We open-source the evaluation environments, human expert data, analysis code and agent trajectories to facilitate future research.},

	abstract = {Gorillas are herbivorous,  predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. The {DNA} of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99\% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees.
Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 metres, weights between 100 and 270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The eastern gorilla is distinguished from the western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild.
Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.
There are thought to be around 316,000 western gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas. Both species are classified as Critically Endangered by the {IUCN}; all subspecies are classified as Critically Endangered with the exception of the mountain gorilla, which is classified as Endangered. There are many threats to their survival, such as poaching, habitat destruction, and disease, which threaten the survival of the species. However, conservation efforts have been successful in some areas where they live.},
