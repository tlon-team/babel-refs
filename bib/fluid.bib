	abstract = {The European Summer Program on Rationality (ESPR) is an immersive summer workshop for mathematically talented students aged 16-19. The program, modeled after the American equivalent, SPARC, covers a wide range of topics including game theory, cryptography, mathematical logic, AI safety, communication styles, and cognitive science. ESPR's goal is to help students develop rigorous quantitative skills while providing them with a toolbox of useful concepts and practical techniques applicable to all walks of life. The program's curriculum includes lectures from intellectuals in cutting-edge fields, with past speakers including renowned theoretical scientist Scott Aaronson and existential risk researcher Shahar Avin.  ESPR's tuition, room, and board are free for all admitted students due to a generous grant from the Open Philanthropy Project. Need-based travel scholarships are also available. – AI-generated abstract.},
