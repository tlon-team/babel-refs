	abstract = {Technology increases consumption but can create or mitigate existential risk to human civilization. Though accelerating technological development may increase the hazard rate (the risk of existential catastrophe per period) in the short run, two considerations suggest that acceleration typically decreases the risk that such a catastrophe ever occurs. First, acceleration decreases the time spent at each technology level. Second, given a policy option to sacrifice consumption for safety, acceleration motivates greater sacrifices by decreasing the marginal utility of consumption and increasing the value of the future. Under broad conditions, optimal policy thus produces an “existential risk Kuznets curve”, in which the hazard rate rises and then falls with the technology level and acceleration pulls forward a future in which risk is low. The negative impacts of acceleration on risk are offset only given policy failures, or direct contributions of acceleration to cumulative risk, that are sufficiently extreme.},

That is, in order to be an eligible bearer of welfare goods and bads, an entity must be capable of phenomenal consciousness. However, this paper argues that, in the absence of a compelling rationale, we are not licensed to accept the View, because doing so amounts to fallacious reasoning in theorizing about welfare: insisting on the View when consciousness is not in fact important for welfare value in a systematic and significant way is objectionably “consciousist.” As a result, the View does not advance our understanding of the value of consciousness. The paper further diagnoses why we may be attracted to the View, and what we should accept instead.},

The public underestimates the benefits of markets, of dealing with foreigners, of conserving labor, and of past and future economic performance. Economists and the public disagree widely about economic policy, and this gap is primarily driven by systematic errors in the public’s thinking. This book argues that voters are irrational not because they are ignorant, but because they prioritize their psychological well-being over their material well-being. Because their votes are unlikely to change the outcome of an election, voters face no material cost for indulging their false beliefs. Politicians, for their part, are not primarily driven by self-interest, but by the desire to win elections by conforming to voter preferences. They therefore have little incentive to correct popular errors. The result is that democracies make a lot of bad decisions, driven by the public’s persistent misconceptions. – AI-generated abstract},

The author argues that freedom is not a static concept but evolves through distinct historical stages. Each stage is characterized by a different understanding of freedom, authority, and order. The Renaissance and Reformation marked a transition from a system of multiple authorities to a single, centralized authority. The Enlightenment period, marked by the rise of absolutism, saw the emergence of a more generalized concept of freedom, with the state playing a dominant role. The revolutionary period, beginning in the mid-eighteenth century, witnessed the transition from freedom as a subordinate to a dominant value. The twentieth century, characterized by the rise of democracy and the clash between individual and collective freedoms, saw the demise of a unified conception of freedom. The author concludes that in the contemporary era, freedom is a dimension of human thought and action, with its character and extent dependent on the particular processes in which it is engaged. – AI-generated abstract},

The book examines the relationship of pressure groups to the evolving concept of ‘the people’ in early Victorian politics and explores how they operated and achieved their goals. Their success was largely dependent upon the ability of their leaders to co-opt and organize different segments of the population, to cultivate the support of sympathetic MPs, and to generate public opinion through a variety of tactics, such as public meetings, petitioning, and the press.

This volume offers the first integrated overview of the state of the art in the psychology and philosophy of rationality. Written by leading experts from both disciplines, The Handbook of Rationality covers the main normative and descriptive theories of rationality--how people ought to think, how they actually think, and why we often deviate from what we can call rational. It also offers insights from other fields such as artificial intelligence, economics, the social sciences, and cognitive neuroscience. The Handbook proposes a novel classification system for researchers in human rationality, and it creates new connections between rationality research in philosophy, psychology, and other disciplines. Following the basic distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, the book first considers the theoretical side, including normative and descriptive theories of logical, probabilistic, causal, and defeasible reasoning. It then turns to the practical side, discussing topics such as decision making, bounded rationality, game theory, deontic and legal reasoning, and the relation between rationality and morality. Finally, it covers topics that arise in both theoretical and practical rationality, including visual and spatial thinking, scientific rationality, how children learn to reason rationally, and the connection between intelligence and rationality.},

For example, two people might agree that forecasting is underrated, but they may be disagreeing on how good forecasting is and on how other people rate it.

	abstract = {Human beings have the unique ability to view the world in a detached way: We can think about the world in terms that transcend our own experience or interest, and consider the world from a vantage point that is, in Nagel's words, "nowhere in particular". At the same time, each of us is a particular person in a particular place, each with his own "personal" view of the world, a view that we can recognize as just one aspect of the whole. How do we reconcile these two standpoints--intellectually, morally, and practically? To what extent are they irreconcilable and to what extent can they be integrated? Thomas Nagel's ambitious and lively book tackles this fundamental issue, arguing that our divided nature is the root of a whole range of philosophical problems, touching, as it does, every aspect of human life. He deals with its manifestations in such fields of philosophy as: the mind-body problem, personal identity, knowledge and skepticism, thought and reality, free will, ethics, the relation between moral and other values, the meaning of life, and death. Excessive objectification has been a malady of recent analytic philosophy, claims Nagel, it has led to implausible forms of reductionism in the philosophy of mind and elsewhere. The solution is not to inhibit the objectifying impulse, but to insist that it learn to live alongside the internal perspectives that cannot be either discarded or objectified. Reconciliation between the two standpoints, in the end, is not always possible.},

@book{Nagel1991EqualityPartiality,
	abstract = {This essay explores the central problem of political theory: reconciling the standpoint of the collectivity with the standpoint of the individual. It begins by arguing that the ethical basis of political theory stems from a division within each individual between the personal and impersonal standpoints. The former represents individual desires, interests, and projects, while the latter represents the claims of the collectivity, producing a powerful demand for universal impartiality and equality. The author argues that the search for a political ideal requires an acceptable integration of these two standpoints, noting that the problem of designing institutions that do justice to the equal importance of all persons without making unacceptable demands on individuals has not been solved. The essay goes on to consider the problem of utopianism, arguing that a political theory is Utopian in the pejorative sense if it describes a form of collective life that humans could not lead through any feasible process of social and mental development. A non-utopian solution requires a proper balance between the ideal and persuasive functions of political theory, demanding both impersonal and personal justification. The author explores the concept of political legitimacy, arguing that its ideal is that the use of state power should be capable of being authorized by each citizen, ultimately requiring unanimous agreement on basic principles and institutions. The essay concludes that a harmonious combination of an acceptable political ideal and acceptable standards of personal morality is difficult to achieve, arguing that the problem of designing institutions that do justice to the equal importance of all persons without making unacceptable demands on individuals remains unsolved. – AI-generated abstract.},

However, the risk of nuclear war has increased due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a potential new arms race. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed weaknesses in global institutions and preparedness, but also spurred innovation in vaccine development. Further, there has been a significant increase in the public's awareness of the dangers of advanced AI, leading to a shift in government policy and an emphasis on regulating AI development. While the overall picture of existential risk is complex, with some risks increasing and others decreasing, there is a growing awareness of the dangers and a developing movement to address these risks.},

	abstract = {One of the world's leading experts on language and the mind  explores the idea of human nature and its moral, emotional, and political colorings. With characteristic wit, lucidity, and insight, Pinker argues that the dogma that the mind has no innate traits-a doctrine held by many intellectuals during the past century-denies our common humanity and our individual preferences, replaces objective analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans, and distorts our understanding of politics, violence, parenting, and the arts. Injecting calm and rationality into debates that are notorious for ax-grinding and mud-slinging, Pinker shows the importance of an honest acknowledgment of human nature based on science and common sense.},

	abstract = {From the author of Enlightenment Now, a short and entertaining book on the modern art of writing well by New York Times bestselling author Steven Pinker. Why is so much writing so bad, and how can we make it better? Is the English language being corrupted by texting and social media? Do the kids today even care about good writing? Why should any of us care? In The Sense of Style, the bestselling linguist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker answers these questions and more. Rethinking the usage guide for the twenty-first century, Pinker doesn’t carp about the decline of language or recycle pet peeves from the rulebooks of a century ago. Instead, he applies insights from the sciences of language and mind to the challenge of crafting clear, coherent, and stylish prose. In this short, cheerful, and eminently practical book, Pinker shows how writing depends on imagination, empathy, coherence, grammatical knowhow, and an ability to savor and reverse engineer the good prose of others. He replaces dogma about usage with reason and evidence, allowing writers and editors to apply the guidelines judiciously, rather than robotically, being mindful of what they are designed to accomplish. Filled with examples of great and gruesome prose, Pinker shows us how the art of writing can be a form of pleasurable mastery and a fascinating intellectual topic in its own right.},

Estas investigaciones le han llevado a concluir que, pese a las guerras de Irak, Afganistán, Darfur y de otros conflictos actuales, vivimos en una época en la que la violencia ha disminuido enormemente respecto de tiempos pasados. La violencia es un fenómeno que se ha desarrollado durante milenios y no cabe duda de que, como nos explica Pinker, su declive tiene unas profundas implicaciones. Disfrutamos la paz de la que gozamos ahora porque las generaciones pasadas vivieron atenazadas por la violencia y ello les obligó a esforzarse para ponerle límites, y en el mundo contemporáneo somos nosotros quienes debemos trabajar para ponerle fin. No debemos dejarnos llevar por el optimismo pero, al menos, ahora sabemos que este es un objetivo que está a nuestro alcance. En definitiva, esta nueva obra de Steven Pinker abre una nueva perspectiva a las ciencias y a nuestra idea del hombre.

One potential avenue for long-term influence involves spreading values that persist and shape the futures that our descendants choose to build. There is some reason to expect that future moral values will be stable. Many groups have preferences about the world beyond their backyard. They should work to ensure that their values are shared by those who can help bring them about. Changes in the values that future groups support will lead to changes in the protections for the things we care about. If our values concern how our descendants will act, then we should aim to create institutions that promote those values. If we are successful in promoting those values, we should expect our descendants to appreciate and protect those institutional choices.},

The author argues that the arrival of such a technology would lead to a dramatic acceleration of economic growth, with rates of output doubling every few months, driven by rapid self-replication of AI and robotic systems. This would lead to a massive expansion of physical capital and industrial output, eventually reaching natural resource limits.  The author then discusses a range of counterarguments from economists, including the Baumol effect, diminishing returns to intelligence, and the difficulty of manufacturing robots. He argues that these objections are based on mistaken heuristics and assumptions about the capabilities of AI. Finally, the author discusses the moral status of AI systems and the potential for AI to be exploited by humans or to become a force of domination. He argues that we should aim for a future of mutually beneficial coexistence with AI systems, but that this will require a careful consideration of AI welfare and the creation of institutions to prevent the abuse of AI systems. – AI-generated abstract},
