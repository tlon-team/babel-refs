	abstract = {The European Summer Program on Rationality (ESPR) is an immersive summer workshop for mathematically talented students aged 16-19. The program, modeled after the American equivalent, SPARC, covers a wide range of topics including game theory, cryptography, mathematical logic, AI safety, communication styles, and cognitive science. ESPR's goal is to help students develop rigorous quantitative skills while providing them with a toolbox of useful concepts and practical techniques applicable to all walks of life. The program's curriculum includes lectures from intellectuals in cutting-edge fields, with past speakers including renowned theoretical scientist Scott Aaronson and existential risk researcher Shahar Avin.  ESPR's tuition, room, and board are free for all admitted students due to a generous grant from the Open Philanthropy Project. Need-based travel scholarships are also available. – AI-generated abstract.},

	abstract = {The first reference on rationality that integrates accounts from psychology and philosophy, covering descriptive and normative theories from both disciplines.Both analytic philosophy and cognitive psychology have made dramatic advances in understanding rationality, but there has been little interaction between the disciplines. This volume offers the first integrated overview of the state of the art in the psychology and philosophy of rationality. Written by leading experts from both disciplines, The Handbook of Rationality covers the main normative and descriptive theories of rationality--how people ought to think, how they actually think, and why we often deviate from what we can call rational. It also offers insights from other fields such as artificial intelligence, economics, the social sciences, and cognitive neuroscience. The Handbook proposes a novel classification system for researchers in human rationality, and it creates new connections between rationality research in philosophy, psychology, and other disciplines. Following the basic distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, the book first considers the theoretical side, including normative and descriptive theories of logical, probabilistic, causal, and defeasible reasoning. It then turns to the practical side, discussing topics such as decision making, bounded rationality, game theory, deontic and legal reasoning, and the relation between rationality and morality. Finally, it covers topics that arise in both theoretical and practical rationality, including visual and spatial thinking, scientific rationality, how children learn to reason rationally, and the connection between intelligence and rationality.},

@online{Lewis2023SayHowMuch,
	abstract = {The author argues that using comparative language such as "overrated" or "underrated" is a poor substitute for direct assessments of the value of something. He proposes that instead of saying "forecasting is underrated", one should directly state how good forecasting is, for example, by giving it a score out of ten. He argues that this approach is more precise and avoids the ambiguity inherent in comparative language. For example, two people might agree that forecasting is underrated, but they may be disagreeing on how good forecasting is and on how other people rate it. The author concedes that direct assessments are more difficult to formulate and require more effort, but ultimately yield a more concrete and nuanced understanding of the topic at hand. – AI-generated abstract.},
