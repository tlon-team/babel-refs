	abstract = {HELLO Comment by {CarlShulman} - I agree it's very unlikely
                  that a nuclear war discharging current arsenals could
                  directly cause human extinction. But the conditional
                  probability of extinction given all-out nuclear war
                  can go much higher if the problem gets worse. Some
                  aspects of this: -at the peak of the Cold War arsenals
                  there were over 70,000 nuclear weapons, not 14,000
                  -this Brookings estimate puts spending building the
                  {US} nuclear arsenal at several trillion current
                  dollars, with lower marginal costs per weapon, e.g.
                  \$20M per weapon and \$50-100M all-in for for {ICBMs}
                  -economic growth since then means the world could
                  already afford far larger arsenals in a renewed arms
                  race -current {US} military expenditure is over \$700B
                  annually, about 1/30th of {GDP}; at the peak of the
                  Cold War in the 50s and 60s it was about 1/10th;
                  Soviet expenditure was proportionally higher -so with
                  1950s proportional military expenditures, half going
                  to nukes, the {US} and China could each produce
                  20,000+ {ICBMs}, each of which could be fitted with
                  {MIRVs} and several warheads, building up to millions
                  of warheads over a decade or so; the numbers could be
                  higher for cheaper delivery systems -economies of
                  scale and improvements in technology would likely
                  bring down the per warhead cost -if {AI} and robotics
                  greatly increase economic growth the above numbers
                  could be increased by orders of magnitude -radiation
                  effects could be intentionally greatly increased with
                  alternative warhead composition -all-out discharge of
                  strategic nuclear arsenals is also much more likely to
                  be accompanied by simultaneous deployment of other
                  {WMD}, including pandemic bioweapons (which the
                  Soviets pursued as a strategic weapon for such
                  circumstances)and drone swarms (which might kill
                  survivors in bunkers); the combined effects of future
                  versions of all of these {WMD} at once may
                  synergistically cause extinction},

	abstract = {The enormous financial success of online advertising platforms
                  is partially due to the precise targeting features they offer.
                  Although researchers and journalists have found many ways that
                  advertisers can target---or exclude---particular groups of
                  users seeing their ads, comparatively little attention has
                  been paid to the implications of the platform's ad delivery
                  process, comprised of the platform's choices about which users
                  see which ads. It has been hypothesized that this process can
                  "skew" ad delivery in ways that the advertisers do not intend,
                  making some users less likely than others to see particular
                  ads based on their demographic characteristics. In this paper,
                  we demonstrate that such skewed delivery occurs on Facebook,
                  due to market and financial optimization effects as well as
                  the platform's own predictions about the "relevance" of ads to
                  different groups of users. We find that both the advertiser's
                  budget and the content of the ad each significantly contribute
                  to the skew of Facebook's ad delivery. Critically, we observe
                  significant skew in delivery along gender and racial lines for
                  "real" ads for employment and housing opportunities despite
                  neutral targeting parameters. Our results demonstrate
                  previously unknown mechanisms that can lead to potentially
                  discriminatory ad delivery, even when advertisers set their
                  targeting parameters to be highly inclusive. This underscores
                  the need for policymakers and platforms to carefully consider
                  the role of the ad delivery optimization run by ad platforms
                  themselves---and not just the targeting choices of
                  advertisers---in preventing discrimination in digital
                  advertising.},

                  limited data on fish farming. In total, we estimate
                  that around 31.0 billion land animals and 38.8 to
                  215.9 billion fish are being farmed globally at any

	publisher = {Springer},
	abstract = {Now available in Open Access, this best-selling textbook for a
                  second course in linear algebra is aimed at undergraduate math
                  majors and graduate students. The fourth edition gives an
                  expanded treatment of the singular value decomposition and its
                  consequences. It includes a new chapter on multilinear
                  algebra, treating bilinear forms, quadratic forms, tensor
                  products, and an approach to determinants via alternating
                  multilinear forms. This new edition also increases the use of
                  the minimal polynomial to provide cleaner proofs of multiple
                  results. Also, over 250 new exercises have been added. The
                  novel approach taken here banishes determinants to the end of
                  the book. The text focuses on the central goal of linear
                  algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on
                  finite-dimensional vector spaces. The author has taken unusual
                  care to motivate concepts and simplify proofs. A variety of
                  interesting exercises in each chapter helps students
                  understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra.
                  Beautiful formatting creates pages with an unusually
                  student-friendly appearance in both print and electronic
                  versions. No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual
                  demand for suitable mathematical maturity. The text starts by
                  discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis,
                  and dimension. The book then deals with linear maps,
                  eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Inner-product spaces are
                  introduced, leading to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem
                  and its consequences. Generalized eigenvectors are then used
                  to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator},

	address = {New York},
	abstract = {Abstract This chapter is about tribute and trade, empire,
                  and markets. This is a set of issues that Roman and Chinese
                  history not only have in common but also present as one of the
                  great challenges to economic history. The core of the matter
                  is contained in the excerpt above from a speech by the
                  Greco-Roman orator, Die Chrysostom us. There is nothing
                  original or exceptional in his way of reasoning. The contents
                  reflect stock themes of ancient moral and political
                  philosophy. This is precisely why it lays bare what I shall
                  refer to as the “paradox of agrarian empire” with such
                  particular clarity. In the quotation we encounter Dio
                  Chrysostomus thundering against the corrupting influences of
                  foreign trade on the character of the Roman conquerors.
                  Imports of foreign rarities and luxuries are described as
                  undermining the moral strength of the imperial people. They
                  place Rome in a position of servile dependence on her
                  inferiors that amounts to a voluntary submission to the
                  payment of a degrading tribute to barbarian peoples.},

	abstract = {Reward learning algorithms utilize human feedback to infer a
                  reward function, which is then used to train an {AI} system.
                  This human feedback is often a preference comparison, in which
                  the human teacher compares several samples of {AI} behavior
                  and chooses which they believe best accomplishes the
                  objective. While reward learning typically assumes that all
                  feedback comes from a single teacher, in practice these
                  systems often query multiple teachers to gather sufficient
                  training data. In this paper, we investigate this disparity,
                  and find that algorithmic evaluation of these different
                  sources of feedback facilitates more accurate and efficient
                  reward learning. We formally analyze the value of information
                  ({VOI}) when reward learning from teachers with varying levels
                  of rationality, and define and evaluate an algorithm that
                  utilizes this {VOI} to actively select teachers to query for
                  feedback. Surprisingly, we find that it is often more
                  informative to query comparatively irrational teachers. By
                  formalizing this problem and deriving an analytical solution,
                  we hope to facilitate improvement in reward learning
                  approaches to aligning {AI} behavior with human values.},

	publisher = {Ecco, an imprint of {HarperCollins} Publishers},
	abstract = {"We often think of our capacity to experience the suffering of
                  others as the ultimate source of goodness. Many of our wisest
                  policy-makers, activists, scientists, and philosophers agree
                  that the only problem with empathy is that we don't have
                  enough of it. Nothing could be farther from the truth, argues
                  Yale researcher Paul Bloom. In Against Empathy, Bloom reveals
                  empathy to be one of the leading motivators of inequality and
                  immorality in society. Far from helping us to improve the
                  lives of others, empathy is a capricious and irrational
                  emotion that appeals to our narrow prejudices. It muddles our
                  judgment and, ironically, often leads to cruelty. We are at
                  our best when we are smart enough not to rely on it, but to
                  draw instead upon a more distanced compassion. Basing his
                  argument on groundbreaking scientific findings, Bloom makes
                  the case that some of the worst decisions made by individuals
                  and nations--whom to give money to, when to go to war, how to
                  respond to climate change, and whom to imprison--are too often
                  motivated by honest, yet misplaced, emotions. With precision
                  and wit, he demonstrates how empathy distorts our judgment in
                  every aspect of our lives, from philanthropy and charity to
                  the justice system and from medical care and education to
                  parenting and marriage. Without empathy, Bloom insists, our
                  decisions would be clearer, fairer, and--yes--ultimately more

                  able to plan for the future. For example great apes save and
                  exchange tools for future use. Here we raise the question
                  whether chimpanzees, orangutans, and bonobos would produce
                  tools for future use. Subjects only had access to a baited
                  apparatus for a limited duration and therefore should use the
                  time preceding this access to create the appropriate tools in
                  order to get the rewards. The apes were tested in three
                  conditions depending on the need for pre‐prepared tools.
                  Either eight tools, one tool or no tools were needed to
                  retrieve the reward. The apes prepared tools in advance for
                  future use and they produced them mainly in conditions when
                  they were really needed. The fact that apes were able to solve
                  this new task indicates that their planning skills are
                  flexible. However, for the condition in which eight tools were
                  needed, apes produced less than two tools per trial in
                  advance. However, they used their chance to produce additional
                  tools in the tool use phase—thus often obtaining most of the
                  reward from the apparatus. Increased pressure to prepare more
                  tools in advance did not have an effect on their performance.

                  aimed to determine the mechanism and air pollutant
                  responsible. The effects of pollution on heart rate
                  variability, blood pressure, biomarkers, and brachial
                  flow-mediated dilatation were determined in 2 randomized,
                  double-blind, crossover studies. In Ann Arbor, 50 subjects
                  were exposed to fine particles (150 $\mu$g/m
 3
 ) plus
                  ozone (120 parts per billion) for 2 hours on 3 occasions with
                  pretreatments of an endothelin antagonist (Bosentan, 250 mg),
                  antioxidant (Vitamin C, 2 g), or placebo. In Toronto, 31
                  subjects were exposed to 4 different conditions (particles
                  plus ozone, particles, ozone, and filtered air). In Toronto,
                  diastolic blood pressure significantly increased (2.9 and 3.6
                  mm Hg) only during particle-containing exposures in
                  association with particulate matter concentration and
                  reductions in heart rate variability. Flow-mediated dilatation
                  significantly decreased (2.0\% and 2.9\%) only 24 hours after
                  particle-containing exposures in association with particulate
                  matter concentration and increases in blood tumor necrosis
                  factor $\alpha$. In Ann Arbor, diastolic blood pressure
                  significantly similarly increased during all of the exposures
                  (2.5 to 4.0 mm Hg), a response not mitigated by pretreatments.
                  Flow-mediated dilatation remained unaltered. Particulate
                  matter, not ozone, was responsible for increasing diastolic
                  blood pressure during air pollution inhalation, most plausibly
                  by instigating acute autonomic imbalance. Only particles from
                  urban Toronto additionally impaired endothelial function,
                  likely via slower proinflammatory pathways. Our findings
                  demonstrate credible mechanisms whereby fine particulate
                  matter could trigger acute cardiovascular events and that
                  aspects of exposure location may be an important determinant

                  statement on "Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease"

                  on many aspects of the current state of science and updated
                  suggestions for areas of future research. On the basis of the
                  findings of this review, several new conclusions were reached,
                  including the following: Exposure to {PM} {\textless}2.5
                  $\mu$m in diameter ({PM}
 2.5
 ) over a few hours to weeks
                  can trigger cardiovascular disease-related mortality and
                  nonfatal events; longer-term exposure (eg, a few years)
                  increases the risk for cardiovascular mortality to an even
                  greater extent than exposures over a few days and reduces life
                  expectancy within more highly exposed segments of the
                  population by several months to a few years; reductions in
                  {PM} levels are associated with decreases in cardiovascular
                  mortality within a time frame as short as a few years; and
                  many credible pathological mechanisms have been elucidated
                  that lend biological plausibility to these findings. It is the
                  opinion of the writing group that the overall evidence is
                  consistent with a causal relationship between {PM}
 2.5
                  exposure and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This body
                  of evidence has grown and been strengthened substantially
                  since the first American Heart Association scientific
                  statement was published. Finally, {PM}
 2.5
 exposure is
                  deemed a modifiable factor that contributes to cardiovascular
                  morbidity and mortality.},

 ) is
                  a major global health concern. Quantitative estimates of
                  attributable mortality are based on disease-specific hazard
                  ratio models that incorporate risk information from multiple
                  {PM}
 2.5
 sources (outdoor and indoor air pollution from
                  use of solid fuels and secondhand and active smoking),
                  requiring assumptions about equivalent exposure and toxicity.
                  We relax these contentious assumptions by constructing a
                  {PM}
 2.5
 -mortality hazard ratio function based only on
                  cohort studies of outdoor air pollution that covers the global
                  exposure range. We modeled the shape of the association
                  between {PM}
 2.5
 and nonaccidental mortality using data
                  from 41 cohorts from 16 countries-the Global Exposure
                  Mortality Model ({GEMM}). We then constructed {GEMMs} for five
                  specific causes of death examined by the global burden of
                  disease ({GBD}). The {GEMM} predicts 8.9 million [95\%
                  confidence interval ({CI}): 7.5-10.3] deaths in 2015, a figure
                  30\% larger than that predicted by the sum of deaths among the
                  five specific causes (6.9; 95\% {CI}: 4.9-8.5) and 120\%
                  larger than the risk function used in the {GBD} (4.0; 95\%
                  {CI}: 3.3-4.8). Differences between the {GEMM} and {GBD} risk
                  functions are larger for a 20\% reduction in concentrations,
                  with the {GEMM} predicting 220\% higher excess deaths. These
                  results suggest that {PM}
 2.5
 exposure may be related to
                  additional causes of death than the five considered by the
                  {GBD} and that incorporation of risk information from other,
                  nonoutdoor, particle sources leads to underestimation of
                  disease burden, especially at higher concentrations.},

	abstract = {This report examines whether advanced {AIs} that perform well
                  in training will be doing so in order to gain power later -- a
                  behavior I call "scheming" (also sometimes called "deceptive
                  alignment"). I conclude that scheming is a disturbingly
                  plausible outcome of using baseline machine learning methods
                  to train goal-directed {AIs} sophisticated enough to scheme
                  (my subjective probability on such an outcome, given these
                  conditions, is roughly 25\%). In particular: if performing
                  well in training is a good strategy for gaining power (as I
                  think it might well be), then a very wide variety of goals
                  would motivate scheming -- and hence, good training
                  performance. This makes it plausible that training might
                  either land on such a goal naturally and then reinforce it, or
                  actively push a model's motivations towards such a goal as an
                  easy way of improving performance. What's more, because
                  schemers pretend to be aligned on tests designed to reveal
                  their motivations, it may be quite difficult to tell whether
                  this has occurred. However, I also think there are reasons for
                  comfort. In particular: scheming may not actually be such a
                  good strategy for gaining power; various selection pressures
                  in training might work against schemer-like goals (for
                  example, relative to non-schemers, schemers need to engage in
                  extra instrumental reasoning, which might harm their training
                  performance); and we may be able to increase such pressures
                  intentionally. The report discusses these and a wide variety
                  of other considerations in detail, and it suggests an array of
                  empirical research directions for probing the topic further.},

                  that greatly increases total suspended particulates ({TSPs})
                  air pollution is causing the 500 million residents of Northern
                  China to lose more than 2.5 billion life years of life
                  expectancy. The quasi-experimental empirical approach is based
                  on China's Huai River policy, which provided free winter
                  heating via the provision of coal for boilers in cities north
                  of the Huai River but denied heat to the south. Using a
                  regression discontinuity design based on distance from the
                  Huai River, we find that ambient concentrations of {TSPs} are
                  about 184 $\mu$g/m
 3
 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}): 61,
                  307] or 55\% higher in the north. Further, the results

                  0.8, 10.2) lower in the north owing to an increased incidence
                  of cardiorespiratory mortality. More generally, the analysis
                  suggests that long-term exposure to an additional 100
                  $\mu$g/m
 3
 of {TSPs} is associated with a reduction in
                  life expectancy at birth of about 3.0 y (95\% {CI}: 0.4,

                  including Atari games and simulated robot
                  locomotion, while providing feedback on less than
                  one percent of our agent's interactions with the
                  environment. This reduces the cost of human
                  oversight far enough that it can be practically
                  applied to state-of-the-art {RL} systems. To
                  demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we show
                  that we can successfully train complex novel
                  behaviors with about an hour of human time. These
                  behaviors and environments are considerably more
                  complex than any that have been previously learned
                  from human feedback.},

	abstract = {Mathematical proof aims to deliver confident conclusions, but
                  a very similar process of deduction can be used to make
                  uncertain estimates that are open to revision. A key
                  ingredient in such reasoning is the use of a "default"
                  estimate of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{E\}[{XY}] =
                  {\textbackslash}mathbb\{E\}[X]
                  {\textbackslash}mathbb\{E\}[Y]\$ in the absence of any
                  specific information about the correlation between \$X\$ and
                  \$Y\$, which we call *the presumption of independence*.
                  Reasoning based on this heuristic is commonplace, intuitively
                  compelling, and often quite successful -- but completely
                  informal. In this paper we introduce the concept of a
                  heuristic estimator as a potential formalization of this type
                  of defeasible reasoning. We introduce a set of intuitively
                  desirable coherence properties for heuristic estimators that
                  are not satisfied by any existing candidates. Then we present
                  our main open problem: is there a heuristic estimator that
                  formalizes intuitively valid applications of the presumption
                  of independence without also accepting spurious arguments?},

	abstract = {Most of the policy debate surrounding the actions needed to mitigate and adapt to anthropogenic climate change has been framed by observations of the past 150 years as well as climate and sea-level projections for the twenty-first century. The focus on this 250-year window, however, obscures some of the most profound problems associated with climate change. Here, we argue that the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, a period during which the overwhelming majority of human-caused carbon emissions are likely to occur, need to be placed into a long-term context that includes the past 20 millennia, when the last Ice Age ended and human civilization developed, and the next ten millennia, over which time the projected impacts of anthropogenic climate change will grow and persist. This long-term perspective illustrates that policy decisions made in the next few years to decades will have profound impacts on global climate, ecosystems and human societies — not just for this century, but for the next ten millennia and beyond.},

	number = {arXiv:2006.08753 [cs.AI]},
	abstract = {If we could define the set of all bad outcomes, we could
                  hard-code an agent which avoids them; however, in sufficiently
                  complex environments, this is infeasible. We do not know of
                  any general-purpose approaches in the literature to avoiding
                  novel failure modes. Motivated by this, we define an idealized
                  Bayesian reinforcement learner which follows a policy that
                  maximizes the worst-case expected reward over a set of
                  world-models. We call this agent pessimistic, since it
                  optimizes assuming the worst case. A scalar parameter tunes
                  the agent's pessimism by changing the size of the set of
                  world-models taken into account. Our first main contribution
                  is: given an assumption about the agent's model class, a
                  sufficiently pessimistic agent does not cause "unprecedented
                  events" with probability \$1-{\textbackslash}delta\$, whether
                  or not designers know how to precisely specify those
                  precedents they are concerned with. Since pessimism
                  discourages exploration, at each timestep, the agent may defer
                  to a mentor, who may be a human or some known-safe policy we
                  would like to improve. Our other main contribution is that the
                  agent's policy's value approaches at least that of the mentor,
                  while the probability of deferring to the mentor goes to 0. In
                  high-stakes environments, we might like advanced artificial
                  agents to pursue goals cautiously, which is a non-trivial
                  problem even if the agent were allowed arbitrary computing
                  power; we present a formal solution.},

                  stakes of existential risk studies ({ERS}) necessitate serious

                  approaches to studying existential risk are not yet fit for
                  purpose, and perhaps even run the risk of increasing harm. We
                  highlight general challenges in {ERS}: accommodating value
                  pluralism, crafting precise definitions, developing
                  comprehensive tools for risk assessment, dealing with
                  uncertainty, and accounting for the dangers associated with
                  taking exceptional actions to mitigate or prevent
                  catastrophes. The most influential framework for {ERS}, the
                  "techno-utopian approach" ({TUA}), struggles with these issues
                  and has a unique set of additional problems: it unnecessarily
                  combines the study of longtermism and longtermist ethics with
                  the study of extinction, relies on a non-representative moral
                  worldview, uses ambiguous and inadequate definitions, fails to
                  incorporate insights from risk assessment in relevant fields,
                  chooses arbitrary categorisations of risk, and advocates for
                  dangerous mitigation strategies. Its moral and empirical
                  assumptions might be particularly vulnerable to securitisation

 In this article, I review recent research showing
                  that even relatively low levels of pollution can affect
                  infants' health. This research attempts to go beyond
                  documenting correlations by using sharp changes in pollution
                  levels, carefully selecting control groups (including
                  unexposed siblings as controls for exposed children), and
                  considering behavioral responses to pollution such as maternal
                  mobility. Poor and minority children are more likely to be
                  affected, and differential exposure could be responsible for
                  some of the observed group‐level differences in health at
                  birth. Policy makers concerned about the roots of inequality
                  should consider the role played by environmental exposures of
                  pregnant mothers.},

                  purpose technology. Future progress could be rapid,
                  and experts expect that superhuman capabilities in
                  strategic domains will be achieved in the coming four
                  decades. The opportunities are tremendous, including
                  advances in medicine and health, transportation,
                  energy, education, science, economic growth, and
                  environmental sustainability. The risks, however, are
                  also substantial and plausibly pose extreme governance
                  challenges. These include labor displacement,
                  inequality, an oligopolistic global market structure,
                  reinforced totalitarianism, shifts and volatility in
                  national power, strategic instability, and an {AI}
                  race that sacrifices safety and other values. The
                  consequences are plausibly of a magnitude and on a

                  growing role across all areas of modern society. Machine
                  learning provides the ability to predict likely future
                  outcomes, to calculate risks between competing choices, to
                  make sense of vast amounts of data at speed, and to draw
                  insights from data that would be otherwise invisible to human
                  analysts. Despite the significant attention given to machine
                  learning generally in academic writing and public discourse,
                  however, there has been little analysis of how it may affect
                  war-making decisions, and even less analysis from an
                  international law perspective. The advantages that flow from
                  machine learning algorithms mean that it is inevitable that
                  governments will begin to employ them to help officials decide
                  whether, when, and how to resort to force internationally. In
                  some cases, these algorithms may lead to more accurate and
                  defensible uses of force than we see today; in other cases,
                  states may intentionally abuse these algorithms to engage in
                  acts of aggression, or unintentionally misuse algorithms in
                  ways that lead them to make inferior decisions relating to
                  force.This essay's goal is to draw attention to current and
                  near future developments that may have profound implications
                  for international law, and to present a blueprint for the
                  necessary analysis. More specifically, this article seeks to
                  identify the most likely ways in which states will begin to
                  employ machine learning algorithms to guide their decisions
                  about when and how to use force, to identify legal challenges
                  raised by use of force-related algorithms, and to recommend
                  prophylactic measures for states as they begin to employ these

                  critical technical {AI} roles here. Organization of this
                  report As these are new metrics and a much wider scope from
                  previous years, we have focused on presenting the data with
                  highlights of trends and outliers to help you get started in
                  exploring the information. Analysis requires a lot of
                  ground-level understanding that we will look to add in
                  subsequent articles and collaborations, along with further
                  points of quantitative analysis that we outline in the
                  conclusion for us and others to take up. This report is
                  divided into four primary sections. The first section is an
                  introduction and executive summary with the rankings of the
                  top countries by talent pool totals. The second explains the
                  different specialized technical roles along the value chain of
                  productizing {AI}, from research to deployment. The third
                  section explores {arXiv} data, a pre-publishing platform that
                  is the closest thing to a census of {AI} research, and looks

	abstract = {Sedimentary basins in eastern Africa preserve a record of continental rifting and contain important fossil assemblages for interpreting hominin evolution. However, the record of hominin evolution between 3 and 2.5 million years ago (Ma) is poorly documented in surface outcrops, particularly in Afar, Ethiopia. Here we present the discovery of a 2.84– to 2.58–million-year-old fossil and hominin-bearing sediments in the Ledi-Geraru research area of Afar, Ethiopia, that have produced the earliest record of the genus Homo. Vertebrate fossils record a faunal turnover indicative of more open and probably arid habitats than those reconstructed earlier in this region, which is in broad agreement with hypotheses addressing the role of environmental forcing in hominin evolution at this time. Geological analyses constrain depositional and structural models of Afar and date the LD 350-1 Homo mandible to 2.80 to 2.75 Ma.},

                  Increase the capacity of the International Atomic Energy
                  Agency ({IAEA}) to verify nations are complying with
                  safeguards agreements. * Work on resolving the key
                  uncertainties in nuclear winter modeling. * Characterize the
                  remaining uncertainties then use Monte Carlo techniques to
                  show the distribution of outcome possibilities, with a special
                  focus on the worst-case possibilities compatible with our
                  current understanding. * Investigate which parts of the world
                  appear most robust to the effects of nuclear winter and how
                  likely civilization is to continue there. Further reading

                  ultimately, the reason for discussing those ideas is to take
                  actions that improve the world. Here are some ways to get
                  involved with effective altruism via the {EA} Forum or
                  elsewhere: * Jobs: Find job listings on the Forum, apply for
                  high-impact career advising, or visit the job boards on 80,000
                  Hours, {EA} Work Club, and Animal Advocacy Careers. *
                  Volunteering: Find volunteering opportunities using the
                  volunteering tag, by visiting {EA} Work Club, by looking at
                  the {EA} Opportunities Board, or by directly reaching out to
                  high-impact non-profit organisations. * Donating: Support
                  high-impact work by donating to high impact causes and taking
                  an effective giving pledge. * Internships and fellowships:
                  Find internships and fellowships on the Forum or visit the
                  {EA} Opportunities Board, which lists everything short of
                  full-time positions. * Startup ideas: Start a high impact
                  non-profit by applying to Charity Entrepreneurship, finding a
                  startup idea from this list of ideas for valuable new
                  non-profit startups (of which there might already be funding
                  available if you want to try one of these ideas). * Research
                  ideas: Find a research topic by looking at the central
                  directory for research questions, or use Effective Thesis to
                  help find a high-impact thesis topic. * Funding opportunities:
                  Seek funding for a high-impact project by posting using the
                  funding opportunity tag, apply to {EA} Funds, or find other
                  funding opportunities. (This page is an experiment: please
                  give us feedback on it!) Use the take action tag for posts

                  anything else. Ideally, this tag will only be applied to posts
                  that discuss an active opportunity. If you see a post that has

	number = {arXiv:1609.03543 [cs.AI]},
	abstract = {We present a computable algorithm that assigns probabilities
                  to every logical statement in a given formal language, and
                  refines those probabilities over time. For instance, if the
                  language is Peano arithmetic, it assigns probabilities to all
                  arithmetical statements, including claims about the twin prime
                  conjecture, the outputs of long-running computations, and its
                  own probabilities. We show that our algorithm, an instance of
                  what we call a logical inductor, satisfies a number of
                  intuitive desiderata, including: (1) it learns to predict
                  patterns of truth and falsehood in logical statements, often
                  long before having the resources to evaluate the statements,
                  so long as the patterns can be written down in polynomial
                  time; (2) it learns to use appropriate statistical summaries
                  to predict sequences of statements whose truth values appear
                  pseudorandom; and (3) it learns to have accurate beliefs about
                  its own current beliefs, in a manner that avoids the standard
                  paradoxes of self-reference. For example, if a given computer
                  program only ever produces outputs in a certain range, a
                  logical inductor learns this fact in a timely manner; and if
                  late digits in the decimal expansion of \${\textbackslash}pi\$
                  are difficult to predict, then a logical inductor learns to
                  assign \${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textbackslash}\%\$
                  probability to "the \$n\$th digit of \${\textbackslash}pi\$ is
                  a 7" for large \$n\$. Logical inductors also learn to trust
                  their future beliefs more than their current beliefs, and
                  their beliefs are coherent in the limit (whenever
                  \${\textbackslash}phi {\textbackslash}implies
                  {\textbackslash}psi\$,
                  \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\_{\textbackslash}infty({\textbackslash}phi)
                  {\textbackslash}le
                  {\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}\_{\textbackslash}infty({\textbackslash}psi)\$,
                  and so on); and logical inductors strictly dominate the
                  universal semimeasure in the limit. These properties and many
                  others all follow from a single logical induction criterion,
                  which is motivated by a series of stock trading analogies.
                  Roughly speaking, each logical sentence
                  \${\textbackslash}phi\$ is associated with a stock that is

                  those actions change at various levels of description, and how
                  different agents' actions can combine when agents work in

	abstract = {We propose a new approach to temporal inference, inspired by
                  the Pearlian causal inference paradigm - though quite
                  different from Pearl's approach formally. Rather than using
                  directed acyclic graphs, we make use of factored sets, which
                  are sets expressed as Cartesian products. We show that finite
                  factored sets are powerful tools for inferring temporal
                  relations. We introduce an analog of d-separation for factored

                  history, so well-known that banks advise customers not to
                  choose it as their {PIN} number - opened the country up to
                  French influence in spectacular fashion. During the
                  \&lsquo;long twelfth century' (up to King John's death in
                  1216) that followed the Norman Conquest, English society was
                  transformed while one French dynasty after another came to
                  power: the house of Normandy in 1066, the house of Blois in
                  1135, and the house of Anjou (the Plantagenets) in 1154.
                  England received a new francophone ruling class and a new
                  culture. The new elite kept their estates in Normandy where
                  their well-established connections across the porous land
                  frontier gave them easy access to the Ile de France, the Loire
                  valley, Flanders and the Rhineland. They sent their sons to be
                  educated on the tournament fields and in the schools of
                  northern France, many of them in Paris, Europe's leading
                  university. Until John lost Normandy and Anjou in 1204 the
                  king of England, as duke of the Normans and Aquitanians, count
                  of the Angevins, ruled a territory four times the size of that
                  ruled by the king of France. A series of \&lsquo;southern'
                  French queens, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Isabella of
                  Angoul\&ecirc;me, Eleanor of Provence, stimulated the royal
                  court to make purchases of sugar, rice and almonds, and of
                  oriental spices such cumin, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg
                  and saffron. Cultural, commercial and political contacts with
                  the Mediterranean world, as well as with France and the
                  Rhineland, were now on a scale not seen since the days, seven

Here, I provide an opinionated survey of the space of plausibly useful definitions of existential catastrophe. Inter alia, I discuss: whether to define existential catastrophe in ex post or ex ante terms, whether an ex ante definition should be in terms of loss of expected value or loss of potential, and what kind of probabilities should be involved in any appeal to expected value.},

	abstract = {For an autonomous system to be helpful to humans and to pose
                  no unwarranted risks, it needs to align its values with those
                  of the humans in its environment in such a way that its
                  actions contribute to the maximization of value for the
                  humans. We propose a formal definition of the value alignment
                  problem as cooperative inverse reinforcement learning
                  ({CIRL}). A {CIRL} problem is a cooperative,
                  partial-information game with two agents, human and robot;
                  both are rewarded according to the human's reward function,
                  but the robot does not initially know what this is. In
                  contrast to classical {IRL}, where the human is assumed to act
                  optimally in isolation, optimal {CIRL} solutions produce
                  behaviors such as active teaching, active learning, and
                  communicative actions that are more effective in achieving
                  value alignment. We show that computing optimal joint policies
                  in {CIRL} games can be reduced to solving a {POMDP}, prove
                  that optimality in isolation is suboptimal in {CIRL}, and
                  derive an approximate {CIRL} algorithm.},

	abstract = {"From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of
                  humanity's creation and evolution--a \#1 international
                  bestseller--that explores the ways in which biology and
                  history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what
                  it means to be "human." One hundred thousand years ago, at
                  least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet
                  today there is only one--homo sapiens. What happened to the
                  others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the
                  history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological
                  approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this
                  highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with
                  the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role
                  evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to
                  charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and
                  science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past
                  developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific
                  events within the context of larger ideas .Dr. Harari also
                  compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades
                  humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have
                  governed life for the past four billion years. We are
                  acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us,
                  but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we
                  want to become? Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25
                  illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work
                  is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for

@Article{Heath2009CircumstellarHabitableZones,
	number = {ArXiv:0912.2482 [Astro-Ph]},
	abstract = {The concept of the Circumstellar Habitable Zone has served the
                  scientific community well for some decades. It slips easily
                  off the tongue, and it would be hard to replace. Recently,
                  however, several workers have postulated types of habitable
                  bodies which might exist outside the classic circumstellar
                  habitable zone ({HZ}). These include not only bodies which
                  orbit at substantial distances from their parent stars, but
                  also snowball worlds with geothermally-maintained internal
                  oceans and even densely-atmosphered worlds with
                  geothermally-maintained surface oceans, which have been
                  ejected from unstable planetary systems into interstellar
                  space. If habitability is not a unique and diagnostic property
                  of the {HZ}, then the value of the term has been compromised
                  in a fundamental way. At the same time, it has become evident
                  that multiple environmental states, differing in important
                  ways in their habitability, are possible even for
                  geophysically similar planets subject to similar levels of
                  insolation, within the classic {HZ}. We discuss an approach to
                  investigations of planetary habitability which focuses on
                  planetary-scale ecosystems, which are here termed -
                  ecospheres. This is following a usage popular amongst
                  ecologists, such as Huggett (1999), rather than that of
                  authors such as Strughold (1953) and Dole (1964), who used it
                  as a term for the {HZ}. This approach emphasizes ecodynamic
                  perspectives, which explore the dynamic interactions between
                  the biotic and abiotic factors which together comprise
                  ecosystems.},

@misc{Hendrycks2023OverviewOfCatastrophic,
	file = {~/Google Drive/library-pdf/Hendrycks2023OverviewOfCatastrophic.pdf},
	abstract = {Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence ({AI}) have
                  sparked growing concerns among experts, policymakers, and
                  world leaders regarding the potential for increasingly
                  advanced {AI} systems to pose catastrophic risks. Although
                  numerous risks have been detailed separately, there is a
                  pressing need for a systematic discussion and illustration of
                  the potential dangers to better inform efforts to mitigate
                  them. This paper provides an overview of the main sources of
                  catastrophic {AI} risks, which we organize into four
                  categories: malicious use, in which individuals or groups
                  intentionally use {AIs} to cause harm; {AI} race, in which
                  competitive environments compel actors to deploy unsafe {AIs}
                  or cede control to {AIs}; organizational risks, highlighting
                  how human factors and complex systems can increase the chances
                  of catastrophic accidents; and rogue {AIs}, describing the
                  inherent difficulty in controlling agents far more intelligent
                  than humans. For each category of risk, we describe specific
                  hazards, present illustrative stories, envision ideal
                  scenarios, and propose practical suggestions for mitigating
                  these dangers. Our goal is to foster a comprehensive
                  understanding of these risks and inspire collective and
                  proactive efforts to ensure that {AIs} are developed and
                  deployed in a safe manner. Ultimately, we hope this will allow
                  us to realize the benefits of this powerful technology while
                  minimizing the potential for catastrophic outcomes.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes and compares 11 different proposals for
                  building safe advanced {AI} under the current machine learning
                  paradigm, including major contenders such as iterated
                  amplification, {AI} safety via debate, and recursive reward
                  modeling. Each proposal is evaluated on the four components of
                  outer alignment, inner alignment, training competitiveness,
                  and performance competitiveness, of which the distinction
                  between the latter two is introduced in this paper. While
                  prior literature has primarily focused on analyzing individual
                  proposals, or primarily focused on outer alignment at the
                  expense of inner alignment, this analysis seeks to take a
                  comparative look at a wide range of proposals including a
                  comparative analysis across all four previously mentioned

	abstract = {We analyze the type of learned optimization that occurs when a
                  learned model (such as a neural network) is itself an
                  optimizer - a situation we refer to as mesa-optimization, a
                  neologism we introduce in this paper. We believe that the
                  possibility of mesa-optimization raises two important
                  questions for the safety and transparency of advanced machine
                  learning systems. First, under what circumstances will learned
                  models be optimizers, including when they should not be?
                  Second, when a learned model is an optimizer, what will its
                  objective be - how will it differ from the loss function it
                  was trained under - and how can it be aligned? In this paper,
                  we provide an in-depth analysis of these two primary questions
                  and provide an overview of topics for future research.},

@online{Johnson2020PurpleairPm2,
	journaltitle = {United States Environmental Protection Agency},
	date = {2020-02-03},
	abstract = {{PurpleAir} particulate matter ({PM}) sensors are increasingly
                  used in the United States and other countries by a variety of
                  individuals and organizations for continuous monitoring of
                  ambient air pollutant conditions, with additional sensors
                  often deployed for monitoring during wildfire smoke episodes.
                  The performance of these sensors must be evaluated during
                  smoke impacted times, and nominally corrected for bias if
                  necessary, to ensure accurate data are reported to inform
                  appropriate health protective actions. Here, we use data from
                  {PurpleAir} sensors collocated with regulatory-grade monitors
                  across the United States to develop quality assurance checks
                  and a multilinear correction equation (including temperature
                  and relative humidity) for {PurpleAir} {PM}2.5 data. A
                  secondary data set was included to test the data correction
                  scheme for wildland fire smoke conditions (including wildfires
                  and prescribed burns) - a series of research field deployments
                  of {PurpleAir} sensors collocated with temporary smoke
                  monitors that are of near-regulatory grade quality ({EBAMs}
                  and E-Samplers). Results suggest that the {PurpleAir} raw
                  {PM}2.5 data overestimate {PM}2.5 by {\textasciitilde}60\% in
                  most states under various conditions. Hourly {NowCast} Air
                  Quality Index ({AQI}) categories are calculated using the raw
                  and corrected {PurpleAir} {PM}2.5 concentrations, as well as
                  for the collocated reference monitor. For the national data
                  set of sensors collocated with regulatory-grade monitors,
                  results show that {PurpleAir} sensors, when corrected,
                  accurately report {NowCast} {AQI} categories 90\% of the time
                  as opposed to uncorrected {PurpleAir} data, which are accurate
                  only 75\% of the time. Testing the correction scheme for the
                  research data set of wildland fire smoke events revealed that
                  the corrected data compared closely with the reference
                  monitors and produced similar {NowCast} {AQI} categories.
                  Interest and concern about air quality has grown in recent
                  years. Simultaneously, growth in the popularity and use of air
                  sensors across the {US} has also occurred especially during
                  wildfires. However, adoption of this technology is limited due
                  to uncertainty and variation in the quality of the data
                  provided. This work evaluates the performance of a popular
                  low-cost {PM}2.5 sensor ({PurpleAir}) across the U.S.. It
                  seeks to inform sensor users of potential data accuracy issues
                  and potential correction methods applicable to both this
                  sensor and other similar low-cost sensors during typical
                  ambient and smoke impacted events. This presentation will be
                  given to the U.S {EPA} {AirNow} team and the U.S. Forest
                  Service on February 3rd to allow them to better understand how
                  to use {PurpleAir} sensors to understand wildfire smoke
                  impacts.},

	abstract = {We study empirical scaling laws for language model performance
                  on the cross-entropy loss. The loss scales as a power-law with
                  model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for
                  training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of
                  magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width
                  or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple
                  equations govern the dependence of overfitting on
                  model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on
                  model size. These relationships allow us to determine the
                  optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models
                  are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally
                  compute-efficient training involves training very large models
                  on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping

	abstract = {Causal models of agents have been used to analyse the safety
                  aspects of machine learning systems. But identifying agents is
                  non-trivial -- often the causal model is just assumed by the
                  modeler without much justification -- and modelling failures
                  can lead to mistakes in the safety analysis. This paper
                  proposes the first formal causal definition of agents --
                  roughly that agents are systems that would adapt their policy
                  if their actions influenced the world in a different way. From
                  this we derive the first causal discovery algorithm for
                  discovering agents from empirical data, and give algorithms
                  for translating between causal models and game-theoretic
                  influence diagrams. We demonstrate our approach by resolving
                  some previous confusions caused by incorrect causal modelling
                  of agents.},

	abstract = {Significance We assessed the effects of air pollution and
                  greenhouse gases on public health, climate, and the hydrologic
                  cycle. We combined a global atmospheric chemistry–climate
                  model with air pollution exposure functions, based on an
                  unmatched large number of cohort studies in many countries. We
                  find that fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65\%
                  of the excess mortality rate attributable to air pollution,
                  and 70\% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. We
                  conclude that to save millions of lives and restore
                  aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, while limiting global
                  warming to 2 °C, a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related
                  emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources
                  are needed. ,  Anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols
                  are associated with climate change and human health risks. We
                  used a global model to estimate the climate and public health
                  outcomes attributable to fossil fuel use, indicating the
                  potential benefits of a phaseout. We show that it can avoid an
                  excess mortality rate of 3.61 (2.96–4.21) million per year
                  from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55
                  (4.52–6.52) million per year by additionally controlling
                  nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related
                  emissions account for about 65\% of the excess mortality, and
                  70\% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The
                  chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust
                  contributes to the aerosol cooling. Because aerosols affect
                  the hydrologic cycle, removing the anthropogenic emissions in
                  the model increases rainfall by 10–70\% over densely populated
                  regions in India and 10–30\% over northern China, and by
                  10–40\% over Central America, West Africa, and the
                  drought-prone Sahel, thus contributing to water and food
                  security. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global
                  temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles
                  liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all pollution particles
                  0.73(±0.03) °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North
                  America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase
                  from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36(±0.06)
                  °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric
                  ozone and methane. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of
                  fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other
                  anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives,
                  restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global
                  warming to 2 °C.},

	abstract = {The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to keep global
                  warming by 2100 to below 2 °C, with 1.5 °C as a target. To
                  that end, countries agreed to reduce their emissions by
                  nationally determined contributions ({NDCs}). Using a fully
                  statistically based probabilistic framework, we find that the
                  probabilities of meeting their nationally determined
                  contributions for the largest emitters are low, e.g. 2\% for
                  the {USA} and 16\% for China. On current trends, the
                  probability of staying below 2 °C of warming is only 5\%, but
                  if all countries meet their nationally determined
                  contributions and continue to reduce emissions at the same
                  rate after 2030, it rises to 26\%. If the {USA} alone does not
                  meet its nationally determined contribution, it declines to
                  18\%. To have an even chance of staying below 2 °C, the
                  average rate of decline in emissions would need to increase
                  from the 1\% per year needed to meet the nationally determined

                  emitted to the atmosphere is governed by a range of
                  sedimentological and geological processes operating on
                  timescales of up to the ca. hundred thousand year response of
                  the silicate weathering feedback. However, how the various
                  geological {CO} 2 sinks might saturate and feedbacks
                  weaken in response to increasing total emissions is poorly
                  known. Here we explore the relative importance and timescales
                  of these processes using a 3‐D ocean‐based Earth system model.
                  We first generate an ensemble of 1 Myr duration {CO} 2
                  decay curves spanning cumulative emissions of up to 20,000 Pg
                  C. To aid characterization and understanding of the model
                  response to increasing emission size, we then generate an
                  impulse response function description for the long‐term fate
                  of {CO} 2 in the model. In terms of the process of
                  carbonate weathering and burial, our analysis is consistent
                  with a progressively increasing fraction of total emissions
                  that are removed from the atmosphere as emissions increase,
                  due to the ocean carbon sink becoming saturated, together with
                  a lengthening of the timescale of removal from the atmosphere.
                  However, we find that in our model the ultimate {CO} 2
                  sink—silicate weathering feedback—is approximately invariant
                  with respect to cumulative emissions, both in terms of its
                  importance (it removes the remaining excess
                  {\textasciitilde}7\% of total emissions from the atmosphere)
                  and timescale ({\textasciitilde}270 kyr). Because a simple
                  pulse‐response description leads to initially large predictive
                  errors for a realistic time‐varying carbon release, we also
                  develop a convolution‐based description of atmospheric {CO}
                  2 decay which can be used as a simple and efficient means of
                  making long‐term carbon cycle perturbation projections.  ,

                  lifetime of emitted {CO} 2     We characterize how

@book{Lovelock2019NovaceneComingAge,
	author = {Lovelock, James},
	title = {Novacene: the coming age of hyperintelligence},
	publisher = {Allen Lane},
	abstract = {James Lovelock, creator of the Gaia hypothesis and the
                  greatest environmental thinker of our time, has produced an
                  astounding new theory about future of life on Earth. He argues
                  that the anthropocene the age in which humans acquired
                  planetary-scale technologies - is, after 300 years, coming to
                  an end. A new age, the novacene has already begun. New beings
                  will emerge from existing artificial intelligence systems.
                  They will think 10,000 times faster than we do and they will
                  regard us as we now regard plants as desperately slow acting
                  and thinking creatures. But this will not be the cruel,
                  violent machine takeover of the planet imagined by sci-fi
                  writers and film-makers. These hyper-intelligent beings will
                  be as dependent on the health of the planet as we are. They
                  will need the planetary cooling system of Gaia to defend them
                  from the increasing heat of the sun as much as we do. And Gaia
                  depends on organic life. We will be partners in this project.
                  It is crucial, Lovelock argues, that the intelligence of Earth
                  survives and prospers. He does not think there are intelligent
                  aliens, so we are the only beings capable of understanding the
                  cosmos. Maybe, he speculates, the novacene could even be the
                  beginning of a process that will finally lead to intelligence
                  suffusing the entire cosmos. At the age 100, James Lovelock

@Article{Marin2018ComputingMinimalCrew,

	abstract = {The survival of a genetically healthy multi-generational crew
                  is of a prime concern when dealing with space travel. It has
                  been shown that determining a realistic population size is
                  tricky as many parameters (such as infertility, inbreeding,
                  sudden deaths, accidents or random events) come into play. To
                  evaluate the impact of those parameters, Monte Carlo
                  simulations are among the best methods since they allow
                  testing of all possible scenarios and determine, by numerous
                  iterations, which are the most likely. This is why we use the
                  Monte Carlo code {HERITAGE} to estimate the minimal crew for a
                  multi-generational space travel towards Proxima Centauri b. By
                  allowing the crew to evolve under a list of adaptive social
                  engineering principles (namely yearly evaluations of the
                  vessel population, offspring restrictions and breeding
                  constraints), we show in this paper that it is possible to
                  create and maintain a healthy population virtually
                  indefinitely. A initial amount of 25 breeding pairs of
                  settlers drives the mission towards extinction in 50 +/- 15\%
                  of cases if we completely forbid inbreeding. Under the set of
                  parameters described in this publication, we find that a
                  minimum crew of 98 people is necessary ensure a 100\% success
                  rate for a 6300-year space travel towards the closest telluric

@thesis{Mogensen2014EvolutionaryDebunkingArguments,
	file = {~/Google Drive/library-pdf/Mogensen2014EvolutionaryDebunkingArguments.pdf},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}I consider whether
                  evolutionary explanations can debunk our moral
                  beliefs. Most contemporary discussion in this area is
                  centred on the question of whether debunking
                  implications follow from our ability to explain
                  elements of human morality in terms of natural
                  selection, given that there has been no selection for
                  true moral beliefs. By considering the most prominent
                  arguments in the literature today, I offer reasons to
                  think that debunking arguments of this kind fail.
                  However, I argue that a successful evolutionary
                  debunking argument can be constructed by appeal to the
                  suggestion that our moral outlook reflects arbitrary
                  contingencies of our phylogeny, much as the horizontal
                  orientation of the whale's tail reflects its descent
                  from terrestrial
                  quadrupeds.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
                  {\textless}p{\textgreater}An introductory chapter
                  unpacks the question of whether evolutionary
                  explanations can debunk our moral beliefs, offers a
                  brief historical guide to the philosophical discussion
                  surrounding it, and explains what I mean to contribute
                  to this discussion. Thereafter follow six chapters and
                  a conclusion. The six chapters are divided into three
                  pairs. The first two chapters consider what
                  contemporary scientific evidence can tell us about the
                  evolutionary origins of morality and, in particular,
                  to what extent the evidence speaks in favour of the
                  claims on which debunking arguments rely. The next two
                  chapters offer a critique of popular debunking
                  arguments that are centred on the irrelevance of moral
                  facts in natural selection explanations. The final
                  chapters develop a novel argument for the claim that
                  evolutionary explanations can undermine our moral
                  beliefs insofar as they show that our moral outlook
                  reflects arbitrary contingencies of our phylogeny. A
                  conclusion summarizes my argument and sets out the key
                  questions that arise in its
                  wake.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {It has been argued that evolutionary considerations
                  favour utilitarianism by selectively debunking its
                  competitors. However, evolutionary considerations
                  also seem to undermine the practical significance of
                  utilitarianism, since commonsense beliefs about
                  well-being seem like prime candidates for
                  evolutionary debunking. We argue that the practical
                  significance of utilitarianism is not undermined in
                  this way if we understand the requirements of
                  practical rationality as sensitive to normative
                  uncertainty. We consider the view that rational
                  decision-making under normative uncertainty requires
                  maximizing expected choice-worthiness, as well as
                  the possibility that different theories’
                  choice-worthiness rankings are not all
                  interval-scale measurable or intertheoretically
                  comparable. Finally, we suggest how evolutionary
                  considerations may increase the practical
                  significance of utilitarianism even if belief in
                  utilitarianism is debunked by evolutionary
                  considerations, so long as belief in competing
                  theories is undermined to an even greater extent.},

                  solution to a given problem specification, expressed with
                  input-output examples or natural language descriptions. The
                  prevalence of large language models advances the
                  state-of-the-art for program synthesis, though limited
                  training resources and data impede open access to such models.
                  To democratize this, we train and release a family of large
                  language models up to 16.1B parameters, called {CODEGEN}, on
                  natural language and programming language data, and open
                  source the training library {JAXFORMER}. We show the utility

	abstract = {Rationale:
 
 
 Epidemiological evidence indicates that
                  exposures to fine particulate matter air pollution ({PM}
                  2.5
 ) contribute to global burden of disease, primarily as a
                  result of increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and
                  mortality. However, mechanisms by which {PM}
 2.5
 exposure
                  induces cardiovascular injury remain unclear. {PM}
 2.5
                  -induced endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation
                  have been implicated, but direct evidence is lacking.
                  
 
 Objective:
 
 
 To examine whether acute exposure to
                  {PM}
 2.5
 is associated with endothelial injury and
                  systemic inflammation.
 
 
 
 
 Methods and Results:
                  
 Blood was collected from healthy, nonsmoking, young adults
                  during 3 study periods that included episodes of elevated
                  {PM}
 2.5
 levels. Microparticles and immune cells in blood
                  were measured by flow cytometry, and plasma cytokine/growth
                  factors were measured using multiplexing laser beads. {PM}
                  2.5
 exposure was associated with the elevated levels of
                  endothelial microparticles (annexin V
 +
 /{CD}41
 -
                  /{CD}31
 +
 ), including subtypes expressing arterial-,
                  venous-, and lung-specific markers, but not microparticles
                  expressing {CD}62
 +
 . These changes were accompanied by
                  suppressed circulating levels of proangiogenic growth factors
                  ({EGF} [epidermal growth factor], {sCD}40L [soluble {CD}40
                  ligand], {PDGF} [platelet-derived growth factor], {RANTES}
                  [regulated on activation, normal T-cell-expressed and
                  secreted], {GRO$\alpha$} [growth-regulated protein $\alpha$],
                  and {VEGF} [vascular endothelial growth factor]), and an
                  increase in the levels of antiangiogenic ({TNF$\alpha$} [tumor
                  necrosis factor $\alpha$], {IP}-10 [interferon
                  $\gamma$-induced protein 10]), and proinflammatory cytokines
                  ({MCP}-1 [monocyte chemoattractant protein 1],
                  {MIP}-1$\alpha$/$\beta$ [macrophage inflammatory protein
                  1$\alpha$/$\beta$], {IL}-6 [interleukin 6], and {IL}-1$\beta$
                  [interleukin 1$\beta$]), and markers of endothelial adhesion
                  ({sICAM}-1 [soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1] and
                  {sVCAM}-1 [soluble vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1]).
                  {PM}
 2.5
 exposure was also associated with an inflammatory
                  response characterized by elevated levels of circulating
                  {CD}14
 +
 , {CD}16
 +
 , {CD}4
 +
 , and {CD}8
 +
 ,
                  but not {CD}19
 +
 cells.
 
 
 
 
 Conclusions:
                  Episodic {PM}
 2.5
 exposures are associated with increased
                  endothelial cell apoptosis, an antiangiogenic plasma profile,
                  and elevated levels of circulating monocytes and T, but not B,
                  lymphocytes. These changes could contribute to the pathogenic
                  sequelae of atherogenesis and acute coronary events.},

	author = {{RandomEA}},
	abstract = {Comment by {RandomEA} - Here are ten reasons you might
                  choose to work on near-term causes. The first five are
                  reasons you might think near term work is more
                  important, while the latter five are why you might
                  work on near term causes even if you think long term
                  future work is more important. 1. You might think the
                  future is likely to be net negative. Click here for
                  why one person initially thought this and here for why
                  another person would be reluctant to support
                  existential risk work (it makes space colonization
                  more likely, which could increase future suffering).
                  2. Your view of population ethics might cause you to
                  think existential risks are relatively unimportant. Of
                  course, if your view was merely a standard person
                  affecting view, it would be subject to the response
                  that work on existential risk is high value even if
                  only the present generation is considered. However,
                  you might go further and adopt an Epicurean view under
                  which it is not bad for a person to die a premature
                  death (meaning that death is only bad to the extent it
                  inflicts suffering on oneself or others). 3. You might
                  have a methodological objection to applying expected
                  value to cases where the probability is small. While
                  the author attributes this view to Holden Karnofsky,
                  Karnofsky now puts much more weight on the view that
                  improving the long term future is valuable. 4. You
                  might think it's hard to predict how the future will
                  unfold and what impact our actions will have. (Note
                  that the post is from five years ago and may no longer
                  reflect the views of the author.) 5. You might think
                  that {AI} is unlikely to be a concern for at least 50
                  years (perhaps based on your conversations with people
                  in the field). Given that ongoing suffering can only
                  be alleviated in the present, you might think it's
                  better to focus on that for now. 6. You might think
                  that when there is an opportunity to have an unusually
                  large impact in the present, you should take},

To accomplish this, countries have submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) outlining their post-2020 climate action. Here we assess the effect of current INDCs on reducing aggregate greenhouse gas emissions, its implications for achieving the temperature objective of the Paris climate agreement, and potential options for overachievement. The INDCs collectively lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to where current policies stand, but still imply a median warming of 2.6–3.1 degrees Celsius by 2100. More can be achieved, because the agreement stipulates that targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are strengthened over time, both in ambition and scope. Substantial enhancement or over-delivery on current INDCs by additional national, sub-national and non-state actions is required to maintain a reasonable chance of meeting the target of keeping warming well below 2 degrees Celsius.},

 The estimated populations of domestic cats in the
                  {USA}, whether pets, stray or feral, vary widely and have
                  changed significantly over the past forty to fifty years.
                  Accurate estimates of these populations are necessary to
                  determine appropriate policy responses to calls to control
                  domestic cats and to determine the impact of domestic cats on
                  wildlife populations. Domestic cat predation on wild animals
                  is being hotly debated in Australia, New Zealand and the {USA}
                  (but much less so in the {UK}). The paper explores some of the
                  different policy approaches being promoted in each country and
                  examines the status of cats in each country. For example,
                  although there is strong movement to control cat predation in
                  New Zealand, the country also has the highest relative (to
                  humans) population of pet cats in the world, despite the
                  vulnerability of native animals to predation by introduced
                  carnivores.},

                  can provide a strong incentive for climate policy through
                  reductions in air pollutant emissions that occur when
                  targeting shared sources. However, reducing air pollutant
                  emissions may also have an important co-harm, as the aerosols
                  they form produce net cooling overall. Nevertheless, aerosol
                  impacts have not been fully incorporated into cost-benefit
                  modeling that estimates how much the world should optimally
                  mitigate. Here we find that when both co-benefits and co-harms
                  are taken fully into account, optimal climate policy results
                  in immediate net benefits globally, overturning previous
                  findings from cost-benefit models that omit these effects. The
                  global health benefits from climate policy could reach
                  trillions of dollars annually, but will importantly depend on
                  the air quality policies that nations adopt independently of
                  climate change. Depending on how society values better health,
                  economically optimal levels of mitigation may be consistent
                  with a target of 2 °C or lower.},

	abstract = {Seneca, Lucius Annaeus, born at Corduba (Cordova) ca. 4 BCE, of a prominent and wealthy family, spent an ailing childhood and youth at Rome in an aunt's care. He became famous in rhetoric, philosophy, money-making, and imperial service. After some disgrace during Claudius' reign he became tutor and then, in 54 CE, advising minister to Nero, some of whose worst misdeeds he did not prevent. Involved (innocently?) in a conspiracy, he killed himself by order in 65. Wealthy, he preached indifference to wealth; evader of pain and death, he preached scorn of both; and there were other contrasts between practice and principle. We have Seneca's philosophical or moral essays (ten of them traditionally called Dialogues)—on providence, steadfastness, the happy life, anger, leisure, tranquility, the brevity of life, gift-giving, forgiveness—and treatises on natural phenomena. Also extant are 124 epistles, in which he writes in a relaxed style about moral and ethical questions, relating them to personal experiences; a skit on the official deification of Claudius, Apocolocyntosis (in Loeb number 15); and nine rhetorical tragedies on ancient Greek themes. Many epistles and all his speeches are lost. The 124 epistles are collected in Volumes IV–VI of the Loeb Classical Library's ten-volume edition of Seneca. The treatises on natural phenomena, Naturales Quaestiones, are collected in Volumes VII and X of the Loeb Classical Library's ten-volume edition of Seneca.},

                  coverage to assess long-term human exposure to fine
                  particulate matter ({PM}2.5) at the global scale. Satellite
                  remote sensing offers a promising approach to provide
                  information on both short- and long-term exposure to {PM}2.5
                  at local-to-global scales, but there are limitations and
                  outstanding questions about the accuracy and precision with
                  which ground-level aerosol mass concentrations can be inferred
                  from satellite remote sensing alone. A key source of
                  uncertainty is the global distribution of the relationship
                  between annual average {PM}2.5 and discontinuous satellite
                  observations of columnar aerosol optical depth ({AOD}). We
                  have initiated a global network of ground-level monitoring
                  stations designed to evaluate and enhance satellite remote
                  sensing estimates for application in health-effects research
                  and risk assessment. This Surface {PARTiculate} {mAtter}
                  Network ({SPARTAN}) includes a global federation of
                  ground-level monitors of hourly {PM}2.5 situated primarily in
                  highly populated regions and collocated with existing
                  ground-based sun photometers that measure {AOD}. The
                  instruments, a three-wavelength nephelometer and impaction
                  filter sampler for both {PM}2.5 and {PM}10, are highly
                  autonomous. Hourly {PM}2.5 concentrations are inferred from
                  the combination of weighed filters and nephelometer data. Data
                  from existing networks were used to develop and evaluate
                  network sampling characteristics. {SPARTAN} filters are
                  analyzed for mass, black carbon, water-soluble ions, and
                  metals. These measurements provide, in a variety of regions
                  around the world, the key data required to evaluate and
                  enhance satellite-based {PM}2.5 estimates used for assessing
                  the health effects of aerosols. Mean {PM}2.5 concentrations
                  across sites vary by more than 1 order of magnitude. Our
                  initial measurements indicate that the ratio of {AOD} to
                  ground-level {PM}2.5 is driven temporally and spatially by the
                  vertical profile in aerosol scattering. Spatially this ratio
                  is also strongly influenced by the mass scattering
                  efficiency.},

	abstract = {As language models become more powerful, training
                  and evaluation are increasingly bottlenecked by the
                  data and metrics used for a particular task. For
                  example, summarization models are often trained to
                  predict human reference summaries and evaluated
                  using {ROUGE}, but both of these metrics are rough
                  proxies for what we really care about -- summary
                  quality. In this work, we show that it is possible
                  to significantly improve summary quality by training
                  a model to optimize for human preferences. We
                  collect a large, high-quality dataset of human
                  comparisons between summaries, train a model to
                  predict the human-preferred summary, and use that
                  model as a reward function to fine-tune a
                  summarization policy using reinforcement learning.
                  We apply our method to a version of the {TL};{DR}
                  dataset of Reddit posts and find that our models
                  significantly outperform both human reference
                  summaries and much larger models fine-tuned with
                  supervised learning alone. Our models also transfer
                  to {CNN}/{DM} news articles, producing summaries
                  nearly as good as the human reference without any
                  news-specific fine-tuning. We conduct extensive
                  analyses to understand our human feedback dataset
                  and fine-tuned models We establish that our reward
                  model generalizes to new datasets, and that
                  optimizing our reward model results in better
                  summaries than optimizing {ROUGE} according to
                  humans. We hope the evidence from our paper
                  motivates machine learning researchers to pay closer
                  attention to how their training loss affects the
                  model behavior they actually want.},

	abstract = {Abstract. We propose a reduced-complexity process-based model
                  for the long-term evolution of the global ice volume,
                  atmospheric {CO}2 concentration and global mean temperature.
                  The model only external forcings are the orbital forcing and
                  anthropogenic {CO}2 cumulative emissions. The model consists
                  of a system of three coupled non-linear differential
                  equations, representing physical mechanisms relevant for the
                  evolution of the Climate – Ice Sheets – Carbon cycle System in
                  timescales longer than thousands of years. The model is
                  successful in reproducing the glacial-interglacial cycles of
                  the last 800 kyr, in good agreement with the timing and
                  amplitude of paleorecord fluctuations, with the best
                  correlation between modelled and paleo global ice volume of
                  0.86. Using different model realisations, we produce a
                  probabilistic forecast of the evolution of the Earth system
                  over the next 1 million years under natural and several
                  fossil-fuel {CO}2 release scenarios. In the natural scenario,
                  the model assigns high probability of occurrence of long
                  interglacials in the periods between present and 120 kyr after
                  present, and between 400 kyr and 500 kyr after present. The
                  next glacial inception is most likely to occur
                  {\textasciitilde} 50 kyr after present with full glacial
                  conditions developing {\textasciitilde} 90 kyr after present.
                  The model shows that even already achieved cumulative {CO}2
                  anthropogenic emissions (500 {PgC}) are capable of affecting
                  climate evolution for up to half million years, indicating
                  that the beginning of the next glaciation is highly unlikely
                  in the next 120 kyr. High cumulative anthropogenic {CO}2
                  emissions (3000 {PgC} or higher), which could potentially be
                  achieved in the next two to three centuries if humanity does
                  not curb the usage of fossil-fuels, will most likely provoke
                  Northern Hemisphere landmass ice-free conditions throughout
                  the next half million years, postponing the natural occurrence
                  of the next glacial inception to 600 kyr after present or

	abstract = {Abstract. The emphasis for informing policy makers on future
                  sea-level rise has been on projections by the end of the 21st
                  century. However, due to the long lifetime of atmospheric
                  {CO}2, the thermal inertia of the climate system and the slow
                  equilibration of the ice sheets, global sea level will
                  continue to rise on a multi-millennial timescale even when
                  anthropogenic {CO}2 emissions cease completely during the
                  coming decades to centuries. Here we present global sea-level
                  change projections due to the melting of land ice combined
                  with steric sea effects during the next 10 000 years
                  calculated in a fully interactive way with the Earth system
                  model of intermediate complexity {LOVECLIMv}1.3. The
                  greenhouse forcing is based on the Extended Concentration
                  Pathways defined until 2300 {CE} with no carbon dioxide
                  emissions thereafter, equivalent to a cumulative {CO}2 release
                  of between 460 and 5300 {GtC}. We performed one additional
                  experiment for the highest-forcing scenario with the inclusion
                  of a methane emission feedback where methane is slowly
                  released due to a strong increase in surface and oceanic
                  temperatures. After 10 000 years, the sea-level change rate
                  drops below 0.05 m per century and a semi-equilibrated state
                  is reached. The Greenland ice sheet is found to nearly
                  disappear for all forcing scenarios. The Antarctic ice sheet
                  contributes only about 1.6 m to sea level for the lowest
                  forcing scenario with a limited retreat of the grounding line
                  in West Antarctica. For the higher-forcing scenarios, the
                  marine basins of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet also become ice
                  free, resulting in a sea-level rise of up to 27 m. The global
                  mean sea-level change after 10 000 years ranges from 9.2 to
                  more than 37 m. For the highest-forcing scenario, the model
                  uncertainty does not exclude the complete melting of the
                  Antarctic ice sheet during the next 10 000 years.},

	author = {Wikipedia},
	abstract = {Existential risk from artificial general intelligence is the
                  hypothesis that substantial progress in artificial general
                  intelligence ({AGI}) could result in human extinction or an
                  irreversible global catastrophe.One argument goes as follows:
                  human beings dominate other species because the human brain
                  possesses distinctive capabilities other animals lack. If {AI}
                  were to surpass humanity in general intelligence and become
                  superintelligent, then it could become difficult or impossible
                  to control. Just as the fate of the mountain gorilla depends
                  on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the
                  actions of a future machine superintelligence.The plausibility
                  of existential catastrophe due to {AI} is widely debated, and
                  hinges in part on whether {AGI} or superintelligence are
                  achievable, the speed at which dangerous capabilities and
                  behaviors emerge, and whether practical scenarios for {AI}
                  takeovers exist. Concerns about superintelligence have been
                  voiced by leading computer scientists and tech {CEOs} such as
                  Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Alan Turing, Elon Musk, and
                  {OpenAI} {CEO} Sam Altman. In 2022, a survey of {AI}
                  researchers with a 17\% response rate found that the majority
                  of respondents believed there is a 10 percent or greater
                  chance that our inability to control {AI} will cause an
                  existential catastrophe. In 2023, hundreds of {AI} experts and
                  other notable figures signed a statement that "Mitigating the
                  risk of extinction from {AI} should be a global priority
                  alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and
                  nuclear war." Following increased concern over {AI} risks,
                  government leaders such as United Kingdom prime minister Rishi
                  Sunak and United Nations Secretary-General Ant{\'o}nio
                  Guterres called for an increased focus on global {AI}
                  regulation. Two sources of concern stem from the problems of
                  {AI} control and alignment: controlling a superintelligent
                  machine or instilling it with human-compatible values may be
                  difficult. Many researchers believe that a superintelligent
                  machine would resist attempts to disable it or change its
                  goals, as that would prevent it from accomplishing its present
                  goals. It would be extremely difficult to align a
                  superintelligence with the full breadth of significant human
                  values and constraints. In contrast, skeptics such as computer
                  scientist Yann {LeCun} argue that superintelligent machines
                  will have no desire for self-preservation.A third source of
                  concern is that a sudden "intelligence explosion" might take
                  an unprepared human race by surprise. Such scenarios consider
                  the possibility that an {AI} that is more intelligent than its
                  creators might be able to recursively improve itself at an
                  exponentially increasing rate, improving too quickly for its
                  handlers and society at large to control. Empirically,
                  examples like {AlphaZero} teaching itself to play Go show that
                  domain-specific {AI} systems can sometimes progress from
                  subhuman to superhuman ability very quickly, although such
                  systems do not involve altering their fundamental
                  architecture.},

                  least one unintended nuclear detonation or explosion, but did
                  not. These incidents typically involve a perceived imminent
                  threat to a nuclear-armed country which could lead to
                  retaliatory strikes against the perceived aggressor. The
                  damage caused by international nuclear exchange is not
                  necessarily limited to the participating countries, as the
                  hypothesized rapid climate change associated with even
                  small-scale regional nuclear war could threaten food
                  production worldwide-a scenario known as nuclear
                  famine.Despite a reduction in global nuclear tensions and
                  major nuclear arms reductions after the end of the Cold War
                  following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, estimated
                  nuclear warhead stockpiles total roughly 15,000 worldwide,
                  with the United States and Russia holding 90\% of the
                  total.Though exact details on many nuclear close calls are
                  hard to come by, the analysis of particular cases has
                  highlighted the importance of a variety of factors in
                  preventing accidents. At an international level, this includes
                  the importance of context and outside mediation; at the

@Online{Wikipedia2023GradientDescent,
	author = {Wikipedia},
	abstract = {In mathematics, gradient descent (also often called steepest
                  descent) is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for
                  finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. The idea
                  is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the
                  gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the
                  current point, because this is the direction of steepest
                  descent. Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient
                  will lead to a local maximum of that function; the procedure
                  is then known as gradient ascent. It is particularly useful in
                  machine learning for minimizing the cost or loss function.
                  Gradient descent should not be confused with local search
                  algorithms, although both are iterative methods for
                  optimization. Gradient descent is generally attributed to
                  Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847. Jacques
                  Hadamard independently proposed a similar method in 1907. Its
                  convergence properties for non-linear optimization problems
                  were first studied by Haskell Curry in 1944, with the method
                  becoming increasingly well-studied and used in the following
                  decades.A simple extension of gradient descent, stochastic
                  gradient descent, serves as the most basic algorithm used for
                  training most deep networks today.},

	abstract = {Effective altruism (often abbreviated {EA}) is a 21st-century
                  philosophical and social movement that advocates "using
                  evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as
                  much as possible, and taking action on that basis". People who
                  pursue the goals of effective altruism, sometimes called
                  effective altruists, may choose careers based on the amount of
                  good that they expect the career to achieve or donate to
                  charities based on the goal of maximising positive impact.
                  They may work on the prioritization of scientific projects,
                  entrepreneurial ventures, and policy initiatives estimated to
                  save the most lives or reduce the most
                  suffering.: 179-195 Effective altruists aim to emphasize
                  impartiality and the global equal consideration of interests
                  when choosing beneficiaries. Popular cause priorities within
                  effective altruism include global health and development,
                  social inequality, animal welfare, and risks to the survival
                  of humanity over the long-term future. The movement developed
                  during the 2000s, and the name effective altruism was coined
                  in 2011. Philosophers influential to the movement include
                  Peter Singer, Toby Ord, and William {MacAskill}. What began as
                  a set of evaluation techniques advocated by a diffuse
                  coalition evolved into an identity. With approximately 7,000
                  people active in the effective altruism community and strong
                  ties to the elite schools in the United States and Britain,
                  effective altruism has become associated with Silicon Valley
                  and the technology industry, forming a tight subculture.The
                  movement received mainstream attention and criticism with the
                  bankruptcy of the cryptocurrency exchange {FTX} as founder Sam
                  Bankman-Fried was a major funder of effective altruism causes
                  prior to late 2022. Within the Bay Area, it received criticism
                  for having a culture that has been described as toxic and
                  sexually exploitative towards women, which led to
                  conversations inside the community about how to create an
                  environment that can better prevent and fight sexual
                  misconduct.},

	abstract = {Abstract  On water‐dominated planets, warming from
                  increased solar insolation is strongly amplified by the water
                  vapor greenhouse feedback. As the Sun brightens due to stellar
                  evolution, Earth will become uninhabitable due to rising
                  temperatures. Here we use a modified version of the Community
                  Earth System Model from the National Center for Atmospheric
                  Research to study Earth under intense solar radiation. For
                  small (≤10\%) increases in the solar constant ( S 0 ),
                  Earth warms nearly linearly with climate sensitivities of
                  {\textasciitilde}1 K/(W m −2 ) and global mean surface
                  temperatures below 310 K. However, an abrupt shift in climate
                  is found as the solar constant is increased to +12.5\% S
                  0 . Here climate sensitivity peaks at
                  {\textasciitilde}6.5 K/(W m −2 ), while global mean
                  surface temperatures rise above 330 K. This climatic
                  transition is associated with a fundamental change to the
                  radiative‐convective state of the atmosphere. Hot, moist
                  climates feature both strong solar absorption and inefficient
                  radiative cooling in the low atmosphere, thus yielding net
                  radiative heating of the near‐surface layers. This heating
                  forms an inversion that effectively shuts off convection in
                  the boundary layer. Beyond the transition, Earth continues to
                  warm but with climate sensitivities again near unity.
                  Conditions conducive to significant water loss to space are
                  not found until +19\% S 0 . Earth remains stable against
                  a thermal runaway up to at least +21\% S 0 , but at that
                  point, global mean surface temperatures exceed 360 K, and
                  water loss to space becomes rapid. Water loss of the oceans
                  from a moist greenhouse may preclude a thermal runaway.  ,
                   Key Points    Increasing solar luminosity will
                  render the Earth uninhabitable within {\textasciitilde}2 Gyr
                    A radiative‐convective transition marks the onset of a
                  moist greenhouse   A runaway greenhouse may never occur,

                  improve policy- and decision-making. We report the results
                  from a large survey of {AI} and machine learning ({ML})
                  researchers on their beliefs about progress in {AI}. The
                  survey, fielded in late 2019, elicited forecasts for near-term
                  {AI} development milestones and high- or human-level machine
                  intelligence, defined as when machines are able to accomplish
                  every or almost every task humans are able to do currently. As
                  part of this study, we re-contacted respondents from a
                  highly-cited study by Grace et al. (2018), in which {AI}/{ML}
                  researchers gave forecasts about high-level machine
                  intelligence and near-term milestones in {AI} development.
                  Results from our 2019 survey show that, in aggregate,
                  {AI}/{ML} researchers surveyed placed a 50\% likelihood of
                  human-level machine intelligence being achieved by 2060. The
                  results show researchers newly contacted in 2019 expressed
                  similar beliefs about the progress of advanced {AI} as
                  respondents in the Grace et al. (2018) survey. For the
                  recontacted participants from the Grace et al. (2018) study,
                  the aggregate forecast for a 50\% likelihood of high-level
                  machine intelligence shifted from 2062 to 2076, although this
                  change is not statistically significant, likely due to the
                  small size of our panel sample. Forecasts of several near-term
                  {AI} milestones have reduced in time, suggesting more optimism
                  about {AI} progress. Finally, {AI}/{ML} researchers also

                  learning ({RL}) to tasks where reward is defined by human
                  judgment, building a model of reward by asking humans
                  questions. Most work on reward learning has used simulated
                  environments, but complex information about values is often
                  expressed in natural language, and we believe reward learning
                  for language is a key to making {RL} practical and safe for
                  real-world tasks. In this paper, we build on advances in
                  generative pretraining of language models to apply reward
                  learning to four natural language tasks: continuing text with
                  positive sentiment or physically descriptive language, and
                  summarization tasks on the {TL};{DR} and {CNN}/Daily Mail
                  datasets. For stylistic continuation we achieve good results
                  with only 5,000 comparisons evaluated by humans. For
                  summarization, models trained with 60,000 comparisons copy
                  whole sentences from the input but skip irrelevant preamble;
                  this leads to reasonable {ROUGE} scores and very good
                  performance according to our human labelers, but may be
