	abstract = {The European Summer Program on Rationality (ESPR) is an immersive summer workshop for mathematically talented students aged 16-19. The program, modeled after the American equivalent, SPARC, covers a wide range of topics including game theory, cryptography, mathematical logic, AI safety, communication styles, and cognitive science. ESPR's goal is to help students develop rigorous quantitative skills while providing them with a toolbox of useful concepts and practical techniques applicable to all walks of life. The program's curriculum includes lectures from intellectuals in cutting-edge fields, with past speakers including renowned theoretical scientist Scott Aaronson and existential risk researcher Shahar Avin.  ESPR's tuition, room, and board are free for all admitted students due to a generous grant from the Open Philanthropy Project. Need-based travel scholarships are also available. – AI-generated abstract.},

	abstract = {The author argues that using comparative language such as "overrated" or "underrated" is a poor substitute for direct assessments of the value of something. He proposes that instead of saying "forecasting is underrated", one should directly state how good forecasting is, for example, by giving it a score out of ten. He argues that this approach is more precise and avoids the ambiguity inherent in comparative language. For example, two people might agree that forecasting is underrated, but they may be disagreeing on how good forecasting is and on how other people rate it. The author concedes that direct assessments are more difficult to formulate and require more effort, but ultimately yield a more concrete and nuanced understanding of the topic at hand. – AI-generated abstract.},
