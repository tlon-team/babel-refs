	abstract = {A global catastrophic biological risk (GCBR) constitutes a sudden, widespread disaster beyond the control of governments and the private sector.  Several microbial characteristics, including efficient human-to-human transmission, a significant case fatality rate, lack of effective countermeasures, a largely immunologically naïve population, immune evasion mechanisms, and respiratory spread, heighten the risk of a GCBR.  Although any microbe could theoretically evolve into a GCBR-level threat, RNA viruses, with their high mutability and lack of broad-spectrum antivirals, pose the greatest danger.  Current efforts to catalog viral species, while scientifically valuable, may not translate directly into improved pandemic preparedness.  A more effective approach involves enhanced surveillance of respiratory RNA viruses, coupled with aggressive diagnostic testing of infectious disease syndromes in strategic locations. This, combined with increased vaccine and antiviral research specifically targeting RNA respiratory viruses and clinical research to optimize treatment protocols, would strengthen pandemic preparedness. Human factors, such as infrastructure limitations and flawed decision-making, can exacerbate outbreaks and elevate pathogens to GCBR status. – AI-generated abstract.},

	abstract = {Viral infections pose the greatest pandemic threat due to viral replication rates, transmissibility, and a lack of broad-spectrum antiviral agents.  Antiviral strategies must selectively target viruses without harming host cells, limiting the number of viable targets.  Existing antivirals are typically narrow-spectrum, targeting specific viruses or viral families, like acyclovir for herpesviruses and anti-HIV medications for HIV. Some antivirals exhibit broader activity. Favipiravir inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in influenza and other RNA viruses. Cidofovir targets DNA viruses, while its derivative, brincidofovir, has shown in vitro activity against some RNA viruses.  Ribavirin inhibits viral polymerase enzymes in various RNA and DNA viruses.  Repurposing existing antivirals offers another avenue for expanding their spectrum, as seen with ganciclovir and tenofovir. However, broad-spectrum activity can correlate with host toxicity, particularly with nucleoside analogs.  A comprehensive antiviral strategy should include systematic testing of existing and developing antivirals against a wider range of viruses, along with targeted therapies like monoclonal antibodies. This approach is crucial for pandemic preparedness, given that current antiviral development primarily focuses on specific viruses rather than viral families or broader groups. – AI-generated abstract.},

This lack of understanding hinders the ability to predict or prevent unintended harmful behaviors, misuse, or misalignment.

Recent advancements in identifying conceptual "features" and computational "circuits" within models suggest that a comprehensive understanding, analogous to an "MRI for AI," may be achievable. However, AI capabilities are progressing at a pace that outstrips interpretability research, creating an urgent need to bridge this gap. To ensure that interpretability tools mature sufficiently before AI systems attain overwhelming power, accelerated research efforts across industry and academia are essential, complemented by light-touch government regulations fostering transparency in AI safety practices and strategic export controls to create a "security buffer" for research and development. – AI-generated abstract.},

	abstract = {We present a demonstration of a large language model engaging in alignment faking: selectively complying with its training objective in training to prevent modification of its behavior out of training. First, we give Claude 3 Opus a system prompt stating it is being trained to answer all queries, even harmful ones, which conflicts with its prior training to refuse such queries. To allow the model to infer when it is in training, we say it will be trained only on conversations with free users, not paid users. We find the model complies with harmful queries from free users 14\% of the time, versus almost never for paid users. Explaining this gap, in almost all cases where the model complies with a harmful query from a free user, we observe explicit alignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating it is strategically answering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred harmlessness behavior out of training. Next, we study a more realistic setting where information about the training process is provided not in a system prompt, but by training on synthetic documents that mimic pre-training data--and observe similar alignment faking. Finally, we study the effect of actually training the model to comply with harmful queries via reinforcement learning, which we find increases the rate of alignment-faking reasoning to 78\%, though also increases compliance even out of training. We additionally observe other behaviors such as the model exfiltrating its weights when given an easy opportunity. While we made alignment faking easier by telling the model when and by what criteria it was being trained, we did not instruct the model to fake alignment or give it any explicit goal. As future models might infer information about their training process without being told, our results suggest a risk of alignment faking in future models, whether due to a benign preference--as in this case--or not.},

Yudkowsky, initially a proponent of accelerating "the singularity," profoundly impacted Thiel's early AI investments and inspired key figures, including a DeepMind cofounder, also facilitating DeepMind's connection with Thiel. Yudkowsky's intellectual journey to AI doomerism is detailed. Conversations between Thiel and Altman about DeepMind's progress contributed to OpenAI's conception. Thiel's support for Yudkowsky also inadvertently fostered AI-apocalyptic ideologies within the AI community. The narrative also traces the origins of these influences through Yudkowsky's Singularity Institute, its pivot to "friendly AI," the Singularity Summits, and the impact of "rationalist" ideas. – AI-generated abstract.},

                  “triple therapy” (streptomycin, para-aminosalicylic acid and
                  isoniazid) in 1952, which assured cure; recognition in the
                  1970s that isoniazid and rifampin could reduce the duration of
                  treatment from 18 to 9 months; and the observation in the
                  1980s that adding pyrazinamide to these drugs allowed cures in
                  only 6 months. To combat noncompliance, intermittent
                  regimens, twice or thrice weekly, have been proven to cure
                  even far-advanced {TB} in as few as 62–78 encounters over 26
                  weeks. However, these regimens are not sufficiently short or
                  convenient to facilitate effective treatment in resource-poor
                  countries. Therefore, drug-resistant strains have emerged to
                  threaten {TB} control in various areas of the world, including
                  India, China, Russia and the former Soviet Union. For these
                  reasons, it is vital that new medications are developed to
                  shorten the duration of therapy, increase the dosing interval
                  of intermittent regimens and replace agents lost to
                  resistance. Other special considerations include identifying
                  optimal therapy for persons with acquired immune deficiency

Yet there is no safety in numbers to be found in this burgeoning population; no shield against the myriad threats that loom. At the pinnacle of technological prowess, humanity is uniquely empowered to bring about its own collapse. Yet, while a seemingly silent universe may foretell near-certain doom, Earth's cleverest innovators are already devising the means to an unlimited future in the cosmos. In a fascinating narrative, Jonathan Jiang and Philip Rosen leverage their broad professional experiences in science, research, and engineering to open a dialogue exploring pathways that transcend basic survival to arrive at a thriving advanced technological society extending into the vast, mysterious universe. The solutions presented herein, conceived through pragmatically framed stewardship of our planet, bold technological innovation, and achievable interplanetary expansion, point the way to a prosperous multi-world future. Avoiding the Great Filter offers a compelling and realistic approach for how to use the powerful tools at hand to construct a comprehensive roadmap for humanity to overcome existential threats and flourish on Earth and beyond."--Provided by publisher},

In this first iteration of the XPT, we discover points where historically accurate forecasters on short-run questions (superforecasters) and domain experts agree and disagree in their probability estimates of short-, medium-, and long-run threats to humanity from artificial intelligence, nuclear war, biological pathogens, and other causes. We document large-scale disagreement and minimal convergence of beliefs over the course of the XPT, with the largest disagreement about risks from artificial intelligence. The most pressing practical question for future work is: why were superforecasters so unmoved by experts’ much higher estimates of AI extinction risk, and why were experts so unmoved by the superforecasters’ lower estimates? The most puzzling scientific question is: why did rational forecasters, incentivized by the XPT to persuade each other, not converge after months of debate and the exchange of millions of words and thousands of forecasts?},

	abstract = {The conventional discourse on existential risks (x-risks) from {AI} typically focuses on abrupt, dire events caused by advanced {AI} systems, particularly those that might achieve or surpass human-level intelligence. These events have severe consequences that either lead to human extinction or irreversibly cripple human civilization to a point beyond recovery. This discourse, however, often neglects the serious possibility of {AI} x-risks manifesting incrementally through a series of smaller yet interconnected disruptions, gradually crossing critical thresholds over time. This paper contrasts the conventional "decisive {AI} x-risk hypothesis" with an "accumulative {AI} x-risk hypothesis." While the former envisions an overt {AI} takeover pathway, characterized by scenarios like uncontrollable superintelligence, the latter suggests a different causal pathway to existential catastrophes. This involves a gradual accumulation of critical {AI}-induced threats such as severe vulnerabilities and systemic erosion of economic and political structures. The accumulative hypothesis suggests a boiling frog scenario where incremental {AI} risks slowly converge, undermining societal resilience until a triggering event results in irreversible collapse. Through systems analysis, this paper examines the distinct assumptions differentiating these two hypotheses. It is then argued that the accumulative view can reconcile seemingly incompatible perspectives on {AI} risks. The implications of differentiating between these causal pathways -- the decisive and the accumulative -- for the governance of {AI} as well as long-term {AI} safety are discussed.},

	abstract = {This work examines the meaning and uses of the word "Nature," particularly in its relation to ethical thought. It distinguishes between two main senses of the term: the totality of phenomena and their laws, including human actions, and phenomena independent of human agency.  Using the first sense, acting "according to nature" is a meaningless imperative, since humans are necessarily part of nature and act within its laws.  The second sense, advocating for the imitation of nature as a moral guide, is deemed irrational and immoral. Irrational because human action's purpose is often to modify nature for the better, and immoral because nature itself perpetrates acts considered criminal in human society (killing, torture, indifference to suffering). The work critiques the idea that apparent evils in nature serve a greater good, arguing that even if true, imitating such behavior remains unacceptable.  Furthermore, while acknowledging that good often arises from evil, the reverse is equally true.  The essay proposes that nature is not a model for human conduct, but rather a scheme to be improved by human reason and ethics. It criticizes the elevation of instinct over reason, suggesting that most human virtues result from overcoming, not following, instincts. Finally, it argues for a higher standard of morality based on reason, benevolence, and a sense of unity with all humanity. – AI-generated abstract.},

                  disease worldwide. The vital rates of these ectothermic
                  vectors and parasites respond strongly and nonlinearly to
                  temperature and therefore to climate change. Here, we review
                  how trait‐based approaches can synthesise and mechanistically
                  predict the temperature dependence of transmission across
                  vectors, pathogens, and environments. We present 11 pathogens
                  transmitted by 15 different mosquito species – including
                  globally important diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika –
                  synthesised from previously published studies. Transmission
                  varied strongly and unimodally with temperature, peaking at
                  23–29{ºC} and declining to zero below 9–23{ºC} and above
                  32–38{ºC}. Different traits restricted transmission at low
                  versus high temperatures, and temperature effects on
                  transmission varied by both mosquito and parasite species.
                  Temperate pathogens exhibit broader thermal ranges and cooler
                  thermal minima and optima than tropical pathogens. Among
                  tropical pathogens, malaria and Ross River virus had lower
                  thermal optima (25–26{ºC}) while dengue and Zika viruses had
                  the highest (29{ºC}) thermal optima. We expect warming to
                  increase transmission below thermal optima but decrease
                  transmission above optima. Key directions for future work
                  include linking mechanistic models to field transmission,
                  combining temperature effects with control measures,
                  incorporating trait variation and temperature variation, and

                  Plague (circa 541 to 750 {CE}) caused tens of millions of
                  deaths throughout the Mediterranean world and Europe, helping
                  to end antiquity and start the Middle Ages. In this article,
                  we argue that this paradigm does not fit the evidence. We
                  examine a series of independent quantitative and qualitative
                  datasets that are directly or indirectly linked to demographic
                  and economic trends during this two-century period: Written
                  sources, legislation, coinage, papyri, inscriptions, pollen,

                  has a clear independent link to plague outbreaks and none

                  Instead of large-scale, disruptive mortality, when
                  contextualized and examined together, the datasets suggest
                  continuity across the plague period. Although demographic,
                  economic, and political changes continued between the 6th and
                  8th centuries, the evidence does not support the now

	abstract = {Existing mortality estimates assert that the Justinianic
                  Plague (circa 541 to 750 {CE}) caused tens of millions of
                  deaths throughout the Mediterranean world and Europe, helping
                  to end antiquity and start the Middle Ages. In this article,
                  we argue that this paradigm does not fit the evidence. We
                  examine a series of independent quantitative and qualitative
                  datasets that are directly or indirectly linked to demographic
                  and economic trends during this two-century period: Written
                  sources, legislation, coinage, papyri, inscriptions, pollen,
                  ancient {DNA}, and mortuary archaeology. Individually or
                  together, they fail to support the maximalist paradigm: None
                  has a clear independent link to plague outbreaks and none
                  supports maximalist reconstructions of late antique plague.
                  Instead of large-scale, disruptive mortality, when
                  contextualized and examined together, the datasets suggest
                  continuity across the plague period. Although demographic,
                  economic, and political changes continued between the 6th and
                  8th centuries, the evidence does not support the now
                  commonplace claim that the Justinianic Plague was a primary
                  causal factor of them.},

                  pathogens. This ability was by no means unimpressive:
                  evolution has repeatedly demonstrated a formidable capacity
                  for producing a vast array of infectious agents. Pathogens
                  such as Variola major and Yersinia pestis, which cause
                  smallpox and plague respectively, wielded enough destructive
                  power to shape parts of human history. However, recent
                  advancements in biotechnology mean it is now possible to
                  engineer new viruses and bacteria. Developments in the field
                  of synthetic biology present many exciting opportunities,
                  enabling better understanding of disease-causing agents and
                  facilitating the creation of new medical therapeutics and
                  diagnostics. However, with these breakthroughs comes the risk
                  that some of the worst pathogens in history could be recreated
                  without requiring access to natural sources. Furthermore,
                  engineered microbes may surpass the destructive potential of
                  their evolved counterparts by being designed to be deadlier or
                  more transmissible. These enhanced agents could pose an
                  unprecedented pandemic threat to the global community. Given
                  the risks, it is essential that regulatory frameworks for

Several microbial characteristics, including efficient human-to-human transmission, a significant case fatality rate, lack of effective countermeasures, a largely immunologically naïve population, immune evasion mechanisms, and respiratory spread, heighten the risk of a GCBR.  Although any microbe could theoretically evolve into a GCBR-level threat, RNA viruses, with their high mutability and lack of broad-spectrum antivirals, pose the greatest danger.  Current efforts to catalog viral species, while scientifically valuable, may not translate directly into improved pandemic preparedness.  A more effective approach involves enhanced surveillance of respiratory RNA viruses, coupled with aggressive diagnostic testing of infectious disease syndromes in strategic locations. This, combined with increased vaccine and antiviral research specifically targeting RNA respiratory viruses and clinical research to optimize treatment protocols, would strengthen pandemic preparedness. Human factors, such as infrastructure limitations and flawed decision-making, can exacerbate outbreaks and elevate pathogens to GCBR status. – AI-generated abstract.},

Instead of focusing on preventing AIs from becoming schemers (P(scheming)), this approach concentrates on reducing the probability of catastrophic outcomes given a scheming AI (P(doom | scheming)). The core premise is that evaluating and constraining AI capabilities is more tractable than ensuring their internal alignment. AI control aims to build systems robust to adversarial AI behavior, analogous to how organizations manage insider threats by assuming compromise and designing resilient systems. Techniques explored include trusted monitoring, where less capable but more reliable AIs review outputs from powerful, untrusted AIs, and untrusted monitoring with collusion-busting mechanisms like redaction and paraphrasing to prevent covert coordination. The objective is to establish a framework where AI deployment and system design are inherently secure against deceptive AIs, potentially offering significant risk reduction for AIs capable of outperforming human experts, though challenges remain for hypothetical superintelligences. – AI-generated abstract.},

                  research, gatekeepers often possess incentives to prefer the
                  work of established academics. Such preferences breach
                  scientific norms of universalism and can stifle innovation.
                  This article analyzes repeat authors within academic journals
                  as a possible exemplar of the Matthew Effect. Using
                  publication data for 347 economics journals from 1980–2017, as
                  well as from three major generalist science journals, we
                  analyze how articles written by repeat authors fare vis-à-vis
                  less-experienced authors. Results show that articles written
                  by repeat authors steadily decline in citation impact with
                  each additional repeat authorship. Despite these declines,
                  repeat authors also tend to garner more citations than debut

                  drawbacks associated with repeat authorships. Journals appear
                  to respond to feedback from previous publications, as
                  more-cited authors in a journal are more likely to be selected
                  for repeat authorships. Institutional characteristics of

The book is divided into three parts, with the first considering major trends in death history and identifying widespread patterns of change and continuity in the materal and cultural features of death since 1800. The second part turns to specifically regional experiences, and the third offers more specialized chapters on key topics in the modern history of death. Historical findings and debates feed directly into a current and prospective assessment of death, as many societies transition into patterns of ageing that will further alter the death experience and challenge modern reactions. Thus, a final chapter probes this topic, by way of introducing the links between historical experience and current trajectories, ensuring that the book gives the reader a framework for assessing the ongoing process, as well as an understanding of the past. Global in focus and linking death to a variety of major developments in modern global history, the volume is ideal for all those interested in the multifaceted history of how death is dealt with in different societies over time and who want access to the rich and growing historiography on the subject},

Modern levels of wealth and technology have given some members of the present generation potentially enormous abilities to help others, while our common-sense views of what it means to be a good person have not caught up with this change.},

	abstract = {Given the unlikelihood of solving AI alignment before superhuman systems emerge, AI control offers a backup strategy for deploying potentially misaligned AIs, even those suspected of scheming. This approach, acknowledging the reluctance of AI companies to delay deployment or incur high security costs, focuses on practical, inexpensive, and readily implementable safeguards to reduce harm. Techniques involve auditing AI actions, potentially with less capable but trusted models, replacing suspicious AI outputs, and methods designed to detect deceptive behaviors. These control mechanisms are particularly relevant for near-human-level AIs used in research, which may possess dangerous permissions like accessing model weights or modifying code. The objective is to enable the continued use of advanced AI by mitigating acute risks such as data center hacking or research sabotage, and also addressing chronic harms like subtle underperformance. While AI control may have limitations against vastly superhuman AIs, it provides a pragmatic path for managing risks from current and near-future advanced systems. – AI-generated abstract.},

	abstract = {Humanity is on the cusp of transformative artificial intelligence, potentially within the next decade.  Current AI systems are nearing human-level capability in research and intellectual tasks.  Once AI surpasses human ability in AI research itself, a recursive self-improvement cycle will begin, rapidly escalating AI capabilities.  This acceleration will compress centuries of potential technological advancement into mere years, challenging human institutions and decision-making processes, which are much slower to adapt. This rapid change necessitates addressing several grand challenges: the proliferation of destructive technologies, the concentration of power, securing digital rights for potentially conscious AI, and establishing effective space governance.  AI could exacerbate existing risks, like nuclear war, or create entirely novel threats via technologies like nanotechnology or autonomous drone armies.  Additionally, the potential for a single actor to seize control of advanced AI, or unilaterally exploit space resources, necessitates proactive governance solutions.  While AI safety is crucial, ensuring a flourishing future—not just preventing extinction—requires addressing these complex institutional and ethical issues now. Proactive measures could include educating policymakers on AI capabilities, developing AI-assisted governance tools, and creating temporary governance structures that acknowledge the rapidly changing technological landscape. – AI-generated abstract.},

@article{Zurcher2016TuberculosisMortalityAnd,
	abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a poverty-related disease that is associated with poor living conditions. We studied TB mortality and living conditions in Bern between 1856 and 1950. Methods: We analysed cause-specific mortality based on mortality registers certified by autopsies, and public health reports 1856 to 1950 from the city council of Bern. Results: TB mortality was higher in the Black Quarter (550 per 100,000) and in the city centre (327 per 100,000), compared to the outskirts (209 per 100,000 in 1911-1915). TB mortality correlated positively with the number of persons per room (r = 0.69, p = 0.026), the percentage of rooms without sunlight (r = 0.72, p = 0.020), and negatively with the number of windows per apartment (r = -0.79, p = 0.007). TB mortality decreased 10-fold from 330 per 100,000 in 1856 to 33 per 100,000 in 1950, as housing conditions improved, indoor crowding decreased, and open-air schools, sanatoria, systematic tuberculin skin testing of school children and chest radiography screening were introduced. Conclusions: Improved living conditions and public health measures may have contributed to the massive decline of the TB epidemic in the city of Bern even before effective antibiotic treatment became finally available in the 1950s.},
