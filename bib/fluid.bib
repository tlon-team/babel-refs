	abstract = {This is the third post on research exploring the interventions to improve the lives of urban wild vertebrate animals in South African cities. We are grateful for the support of a grant from {EA} Animal Welfare Fund. The aim of this post is to catalogue existing methods for managing the population of Cape chacma baboons living in the Cape peninsula, with a focus on welfare impacts for the baboons. Where appropriate, we indicate which existing methods might be prioritised or modified, to improve baboons’ welfare. Since urban baboon populations are not widespread globally, many of these insights are particular to the local context. However, some insights may be generalised to contexts where urban wildlife populations share certain characteristics with the Cape chacma baboon.
Relative to more numerous urban wild animal populations considered “pests” (e.g. rats and pigeons), we think that the importance of interventions to improve welfare of Cape baboons is low. Recent data (in the past {\textasciitilde}5 years) indicates that annual baboon deaths are relatively low (and have been decreasing). The baboon population seems to be stabilizing around a suggested carrying capacity of {\textasciitilde}480 baboons. Fewer baboons die from (direct or indirect) human causes than from natural causes (including infanticide).
Neglectedness is also relatively low compared to rats and pigeons. The problem seems relatively well-recognised and researched. The City of Cape Town has devoted resources to the existing Urban Baboon Programme (see below), which seems to have been fairly effective at keeping baboons out of urban areas. The issue has received research and media attention.
Nevertheless, Cape baboon welfare matters, and efforts to improve their welfare are worthwhile. Improving their welfare seems relatively tractable, e.g. there seems to be reasonably broad “buy in” for humane methods of keeping humans and baboons separate.},

Several interventions enhance cognitive functions such as intelligence and decision making. If we identify effective, cheap and scalable cognitive enhancement interventions, they may be competitive with {GiveWell} charities.
In the long term, cognitive enhancement may act as an accelerator for technological development. There are concerns that this rapid development could increase the ability of small groups to cause harm and therefore increase anthropogenic existential risk. However, improved decision making in the long term would be desirable.
The two barriers to tractability are poor coordination in the research field and regulatory barriers to licensing medications. Current developments in cognitive enhancement have happened mainly as byproducts of other research fields. It lacks a cohesive scientific community. There are no apparent evolutionary barriers to solvability. However, there are significant regulatory barriers as new medicines must be licensed to treat a specific medical condition.
Cognitive enhancement research is neglected in comparison to similar fields. There is considerable uncertainty around funding from non-public, pharmaceutical and government sources. Overall, there may be impactful funding opportunities for effective altruists in cognitive enhancement research.},

	abstract = {Agricultural land redistribution is a type of agrarian reform in which large farms are broken up and distributed to tenants or landless peasants.
Land redistribution typically requires exceptional circumstances to succeed. Past redistributive efforts have been most successful in the aftermath of revolution, war, or independence.
When redistribution has succeeded, it has been accompanied by extensive agricultural support, such as rural infrastructure development, subsidies for fertilizers and high-yield seeds, agronomic training, and cheap credit.
The main value of redistribution appears to be improved agricultural yields, but redistribution is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for improved yields.
The exact mechanism by which redistribution improves yields is unclear. Redistribution creates smaller farms, and there’s some evidence that smaller farms have higher yields. (A common theory to explain this is that small landowners face better incentives than landless tenants, so they provide more labor and invest more in improving yield.) However, it’s also possible that redistribution in isolation provides little benefit to yields. Recent evidence suggests either a U-shaped or flat relationship between yields and farm size, suggesting that consolidation could be as attractive an option (for improving yields) as redistribution.
There appear to be no large and reputable {NGOs} that advocate for radical land redistribution. {NGOs} that promote tenure reform (another type of land reform) might be convinced to advocate for redistribution.
Our weakly held belief is that South Asia is the best region to pursue land redistribution.
We believe that advocating for agricultural land redistribution is unlikely to be a cost-effective intervention and very intractable.},

	abstract = {In this post I describe a simple institution for altruistic funding and decision-making, characterized by the creation and exchange of "certificates of impact." I’m interested in your thoughts and criticisms.

Typically an effectiveness-minded altruist would try to do as much good as possible. Instead, users of the certificates system try to collect certificates for as much good as possible.

Whenever anyone does anything, they can declare themselves to own an associated certificate of impact. Users of the system treat owning a certificate for X as equivalent to doing X themselves. In the case where certificates never change hands, this reduces precisely to the status quo.

The primary difference is that certificates can also be bought, sold, or bartered; an altruist can acquire certificates through any combination of doing good themselves, and purchasing certificates from others.

For example, a project to develop a malaria vaccine might be financed by investors. If the project succeeds the developers can declare themselves owners of an associated certificate, and distribute it to investors in the same way they might distribute profits. These investors could then resell this certificate to a philanthropist who is interested in funding malaria prevention and who honors certificates. The philanthropist would recognize the certificate as valuable to the extent that they believed that the original project was causally responsible for the development of the vaccine, and their willingness to pay would be the same as their willingness to develop the vaccine themselves (evaluated with the benefit of hindsight).

Note that judging the value of a certificate is just as subjective as judging the value of the underlying activity, and is done separately by any philanthropist considering acquiring that certificate.},

	abstract = {Global health and development is still arguably the most popular {EA} cause. For example, payouts from the Global Health and Development {EA} Fund comprise 45 percent of the total amount of money granted from {EA} Funds. Almost all of this spending supports so-called “randomista”-type development: direct interventions that have strong experimental evidence of effectiveness. This allocation is justified by the claim that these interventions are the most cost-effective way to improve the lives of people in low- and middle-income countries ({LMICs}).
Earlier this year, John Halstead and Hauke Hillebrandt published an {EA} Forum post that argued this is likely mistaken. In “Growth and the case against randomista development” they write that past poverty alleviation has overwhelmingly been achieved by economic growth, not direct interventions. They argue that the magnitude of the gains of growth are so large that interventions which can increase growth rates are likely more cost-effective even if there is less evidence of their effectiveness or they have a low chance of success.
The post generated a lot of discussion and commenters raised several important potential objections. These included:
Growth work is not neglected and there are no good marginal funding {opportunitiesEconomic} growth does not make people much {happierEconomic} growth does not help the poorest of the {poorWe} are clueless about the causes of {growthImplementing} better economic policies faces political economy challenges that {EA} funding cannot overcome
Over the past few months, we have spent between 100 and 150 hours looking deeper into these challenges to try to determine the likelihood of finding concrete, cost-effective funding opportunities to promote economic growth. We conducted a brief literature review, but given the breadth of the subject matter and the uncertainty of the research question we relied heavily on conversations with experts. After about 30 such interviews, we’ve decided to stop looking for concrete funding opportunities for now. So far we haven’t found any growth-focused policies or programs which experts agree would be highly-valuable to support. We think good opportunities probably exist, but identifying them will require thorough evaluations of potential funding opportunities. Since evaluating policy-focused interventions requires considerable investment from both us and representatives from the organisation under investigation, we’re deprioritizing this project for now. We’re posting this wrap-up to share what we’ve learned, get feedback on our current conclusions, and stimulate further discussion on this important topic.},

	abstract = {How we should spend our philanthropic resources over time depends on how much we discount the future. A higher discount rate means we should spend more now; a lower discount rate tells us to spend less now and more later.
We (probably) should not assign less moral value to future beings, but we should still discount the future based on the possibility of extinction, expropriation, value drift, or changes in philanthropic opportunities.
According to the Ramsey model, if we estimate the discount rate based on those four factors, that tells us how quickly we should consume our resources[1].
We can decrease the discount rate, most notably by reducing existential risk and guarding against value drift. We still have a lot to learn about the best ways to do this.
According to a simple model, improving our estimate of the discount rate might be the top effective altruist priority.

Effective altruists can become more effective by carefully considering how they should spread their altruistic consumption over time. This subject receives some attention in the {EA} community, but a lot of low hanging fruit still exists, and {EAs} could probably do substantially more good by further optimizing their consumption schedules (for our purposes, "consumption" refers to money spent trying to improve the world).
So, how should altruists use their resources over time? In 1928, Frank Ramsey developed what is now known as the Ramsey model. In this model, a philanthropic actor has some stock of invested capital that earns interest over time. They want to know how to maximize utility by spending this capital over time. The key question is, at what rate should they spend to maximize utility?
(Further suppose this philanthropic actor is the sole funder of a cause. If other actors also fund this cause, that substantially changes considerations because you have to account for how they spend their money[2]. For the purposes of this essay, I will assume the cause we care about only has one funder, or that all funders can coordinate.)
Specifically, we assume the actor's capital grows according to a constant (risk-free) interest rate r. Additionally, we discount future utility at some rate δ, so that if performing some action this year would produce 1 utility, next year it will only give us 1−δ discounted utility. The actor then needs to decide at what rate to consume their capital.
Total utility equals the sum of discounted utilities at each moment in time. In mathematical terms, we write it as
U=∫∞0e−δtu(c(t))dt
where c(t) gives the amount of resources to be consumed (that is, spent on altruistic endeavors) at time t, and u(c) gives utility of consumption.
This model makes many simplifications—see Ramsey (1928)[3] and Greaves (2017)[4] for a detailing of the required assumptions, of both an empirical and a philosophical nature. To keep this essay relatively simple, I will take the Ramsey model as given, but it should be noted that changing these assumptions could change the results.
It is common to assume that actors have constant relative risk aversion ({CRRA}), which means their level of risk aversion},

This post gives an overview of the issue in four parts: the neglectedness of fish welfare in general, the number of cleaner fish stocked in salmon farms and the reasons for this, the welfare issues cleaner fish endure, and suggestions for what can be done about this problem. Most data is from Norway, the world's largest producer of farmed salmon. Key takeaways:
Despite strong evidence for fishes' capacity to suffer, their welfare has long been neglected by both fishing industries and animal advocates.Sea lice is a big problem in salmonid farming, and after lice have become increasingly resistant to chemical treatment, other delousing methods have been employed, the least harmful to salmon of these being cleaner fish.Cleaner fish are not adapted to the environment that salmon live in and face disease and high mortality rates. There are also many problems with the way they are treated by the Norwegian cleaner fish and salmon industries.The evidence of cleaner fishes' effectiveness at delousing salmon is sparse, and it is argued that it is not adequate to justify the widespread use of cleaner fish.Suggested interventions are corporate outreach to improve cleaner fish welfare, or to end the use of cleaner fish entirely, as well as working on shifting the public opinions about fishes' welfare and moral value.},

	abstract = {Toby Ord didn’t start his career thinking about the far future. When the Oxford philosopher created the organization Giving What We Can ({GWWC}) in 2009, it focused on finding the most cost-effective charities for saving or improving lives today, like malaria bed nets, and encouraging members to pledge 10 percent of their income to those charities. This marked the beginning of the movement known as effective altruism ({EA}), which describes itself as “about using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis.”
Thirty-seven years before Ord created the {EA} movement, Princeton philosopher Peter Singer formed the ideas that now underpin it. In his 1972 essay, Famine, Affluence, and Morality, Singer offered the following thought experiment:

...if I am walking past a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to wade in and pull the child out. This will mean getting my clothes muddy, but this is insignificant, while the death of the child would presumably be a bad thing...It makes no moral difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor’s child ten yards from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away.

Singer taught, as {EA} now does, to look beyond one’s immediate circle to humanity as a whole when weighing how to do good. If saving a drowning child in front of you is worth some sacrifice, it must be worth the same sacrifice to save an out-of-view child from perishing, as well.
But what if the metaphorical drowning child, rather than being 10,000 miles away, is 10,000 years in the future? This is the question Ord explores in his 2020 book, The Precipice. The risks he considers are not children dying from preventable disease, but of children never being born at all—not hundreds or thousands of children, but billions or trillions of them throughout humanity’s vast potential future. Whether our species can end suffering, explore other worlds, and experience the unimaginable, all depends on whether we can survive to continue our story.
Ord argues that we may be living through the most important time in history, when our technological power is growing so rapidly that we could make humanity’s final mistake. Climate change, nuclear war, pandemics, or unaligned artificial intelligence could all spell the end of humanity if we’re not careful. The extremely high stakes of safeguarding humanity’s future potential makes it worth fighting for, even if the probability of catastrophe is low—and in estimating its odds at 1 in 6, Ord doesn’t believe it to be so low. He brought his optimism from addressing global poverty, identifying specific ways that individuals can help, not just by donating to effective organizations working to minimize existential risks, but also by directing their own careers to make the biggest difference.

{TL};{DR} of my case for this:
It seems plausible that better housing policy could boost the {UK}'s {GDP} by more than a fifth, with all the attendant benefits of extra economic growth.The current government has some interest in doing this, but needs more pressure to do it and good policy ideas for how to do it.There are a couple of organisations I think are doing particularly good work in this area in that they're focusing on what I think the key problem is (housing supply) and have good ideas for how to solve the problem.I think that a few tens of thousands of pounds could make a big difference here
We should have a high bar for funding interventions to help people in rich countries in the short to medium term. Being wealthy, their citizens can afford much higher rates of consumption and their governments can spend at much higher rates, so many of their strongest needs are met. Giving money directly to these relatively wealthy people is not as effective as giving to people who are roughly x100 poorer. Further, there are interventions {\textasciitilde} x10 as good as giving money to these poorer people. This leads to Open Philanthropy arguing that {EA} interventions in rich countries should seek to meet the x1000 bar.
It is difficult to find causes that meet this standard (though the x100 bar for simple cash transfers is easier to meet and arguably more relevant for the long term).
I think changing housing policy in rich countries is a plausible cause that meets this bar, particularly in areas with the highest costs of housing and highest productivity. Here is a rough cost-effectiveness model that suggests housing policy could meet the bar.
I think that the {UK}’s housing policy is among the worst of all rich countries, and to date has not received the funding or attention that {US} housing policy has. Founders Pledge commissioned a great report on this area, focussing on the {UK}. In contrast, Open Philanthropy has already put several million dollars into funding this cause in the {US}.},

I think this might be a mistake.This isn’t to say that epistemics haven’t been discussed. Leaders and community members on {LessWrong} and the {EA} Forum have written extensively on epistemic rationality, “good judgment”, decision making, and so on. These communities seem to have a particular interest in “good epistemics.”But for all the blog posts on the topic, there is less in terms of long term and full-time efforts. We don’t have teams outlining lists of possible large scale epistemic interventions and estimating their cost-effectiveness, like an epistemics version of the Happier Lives Institute. We don’t have a Global Priorities Institute equivalent trying to formalize and advance the ideas from The Sequences. We have very little work outline what optimistic epistemic scenarios we could hope for 10 to 200 years out from now.I intend to personally spend a significant amount of time on these issues going forward. I have two main goals. One is to better outline what I think work in this area could look like and how valuable it might be to pursue. The second is to go about doing work in this area in ways that both test the area and hopefully help layout groundwork that makes it easier for more people to join in.One possible reason for a lack of effort in the space is that the current naming and organization is a bit of a mess. We have a bundle of related terms without clear delineations. I imagine that if I asked different people how they would differentiate “epistemics”, “epistemic rationality”, “epistemology”, “decision making”, “good judgment”, “rationality”, “good thinking”, and the many subcategories of these things, I’d get many conflicting and confused answers. So some of my goal is to try to highlight some clusters particularly worth paying attention to and formalize what they mean in a way that would be useful to make decisions going forward.I’ll begin by introducing two (hopefully) self-evident ideas. “Epistemic Progress” and “Effective Epistemics.” You can think of “Epistemic Progress” as the “epistemics” subset of “Progress Studies”, and “Effective Epistemics” as the epistemic version of “Effective Altruism.” I don’t mean this as an authoritative cornerstone, but rather as pragmatic intuitions to get us through the next few posts. These names are chosen mainly because I think they would be the most obvious to the audience I expect to be reading this.Effective Epistemics“Effective Epistemics” is essentially “whatever seems to work at making individuals or groups of people more correct about things for pragmatic purposes.” It’s a bit higher level than Value of information.

Research may help us assess which actions will most cost-effectively make progress. Tentatively, we argue that outreach on this topic should first focus on researchers and other stakeholders who have adjacent interests.
Imagine that you develop a brain disease like Alzheimer’s, but that a cutting-edge treatment has been developed. Doctors replace the damaged neurons in your brain with computer chips that are functionally identical to healthy neurons. After your first treatment that replaces just a few thousand neurons, you feel no different. As your condition deteriorates, the treatments proceed and, eventually, the final biological neuron in your brain is replaced. Still, you feel, think, and act exactly as you did before. It seems that you are as sentient as you were before. Your friends and family would probably still care about you, even though your brain is now entirely artificial.[1]
This thought experiment suggests that artificial sentience ({AS}) is possible[2] and that artificial entities, at least those as sophisticated as humans, could warrant moral consideration. Many scholars seem to agree.[3]},

	abstract = {Randomista development ({RD}) is a form of development economics which evaluates and promotes interventions that can be tested by randomised controlled trials ({RCTs}). It is exemplified by {GiveWell} (which primarily works in health) and the randomista movement in economics (which primarily works in economic development).
Here we argue for the following claims, which we believe to be quite weak:
Prominent economists make plausible arguments which suggest that research on and advocacy for economic growth in low- and middle-income countries is more cost-effective than the things funded by proponents of randomista development.Effective altruists have devoted too little attention to these arguments.Assessing the soundness of these arguments should be a key focus for current generation-focused effective altruists over the next few years.
We hope to start a conversation on these questions, and potentially to cause a major reorientation within {EA}.
We also believe the following stronger claims:
4. Improving health is not the best way to increase growth.
5. A {\textasciitilde}4 person-year research effort will find donation opportunities working on economic growth in {LMICs} which are substantially better than {GiveWell}’s top charities from a current generation human welfare-focused point of view.
However, economic growth is not all that matters. {GDP} misses many crucial determinants of human welfare, including leisure time, inequality, foregone consumption from investment, public goods, social connection, life expectancy, and so on. A top priority for effective altruists should be to assess the best way to increase human welfare outside of the constraints of randomista development, i.e. allowing intervention that have not or cannot be tested by {RCTs}.
We proceed as follows:
We define randomista development and contrast it with research and advocacy for growth-friendly policies in low- and middle-income countries.We show that randomista development is overrepresented in {EA}, and that, in contradistinction, research on and advocacy for growth-friendly economic policy (we refer to this as growth throughout) is {underrepresentedWe} then show why some prominent economists believe that, a priori, growth is much more effective than most {RD} interventions.We present a quantitative model that tries to formalize these intuitions and allows us to compare global development interventions with economic growth interventions. The model suggests that under plausible assumptions a hypothetical growth intervention can be thousands of times more cost-effective than typical {RD} interventions such as cash-transfers. However, when these assumptions are relaxed and compared to the very good {RD} interventions, growth interventions are on a similar level of effectiveness as {RD} interventions.We consider various possible objections and qualifications to our argument.},

This document sets out:
What populism is, what its impacts and causes are, and who is working on this cause {alreadyWhat} a philanthropist could do to tackle the problem
Our analysis informed our ranking of which broad causes are specifically effective to decrease populism, which is based on qualitative subjective impressions. We concluded that improving rationality, institutional decision making and evidence-based policy are particularly promising.

This should just be seen as a rough guide towards finding potentially highly effective interventions.
Throughout the report we highlight concrete ideas of things that a philanthropist could fund. We distinguish between “funding ideas”, which are promising broad areas that could be explored further, and “funding opportunities”, which are a bit more concrete because we have found a non-profit or academic researcher that is already working on a very promising idea or project that seem plausibly highly effective and that could be funded in the very near term. Our rough ranking of promising funding opportunities is as follows:

For instance, our top choice is the Initiative on Global Markets ({IGM}), a research center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Specifically, their “Economics Experts Panel”, regularly polls top economists on economic policy questions. A philanthropist could fund this project so that it can be expanded. Basing economic policy on expert consensus should be robustly positive.},

	abstract = {In 2011 I came across Giving What We Can, which shortly blossomed into effective altruism. Call me a geek if you like but I found it exciting, like really exciting. Here were people thinking super carefully about the most effective ways to have an impact, to create change, to build a better world. Suddenly a boundless opportunity to do vast amounts of good opened up before my eyes. I had only just got involved and by giving to fund bednets and had already magnified my impact on the world 100 times.
And this was just the beginning. Obviously bednets were not the most effective charitable intervention, they were just the most effective we had found to date – with just a tiny amount of research. Imagine what topic could be explored next: the long run effects of interventions, economic growth, political change, geopolitics, conflict studies, etc. We could work out how to compare charities of vastly different cause areas, or how to do good beyond donations (some people were already starting to talk about career choices). Some people said we should care about animals (or {AI} risk), I didn’t buy it (back then), but imagine, we could work out what different value sets lead to different causes and the best charities for each.
As far as I could tell the whole field of optimising for impact seemed vastly under-explored. This wasn’t too surprising – most people don’t seem to care that much about doing charitable giving well and anyway it was only just coming to light how truly bad our intuitions were at making charitable choices (with the early 2000’s aid skepticism movement).
Looking back, I was optimistic. Yet in some regards my optimism was well-placed. In terms of spreading ideas, my small group of geeky uni friends went on to create something remarkable, to shift £m if not £bn of donations to better causes, to help 1000s maybe 100,000s of people make better career decisions. I am no longer surprised if a colleague, tinder date or complete stranger has heard of effective altruism ({EA}) or gives money to {AMF} (a bednet charity).
However, in terms of the research I was so excited about, of developing the field of how to do good, there has been minimal progress. After nearly a decade, bednets and {AI} research still seem to be at the top of everyone’s Christmas donations wish list. I think I assumed that someone had got this covered, that {GPI} or {FHI} or whoever will have answers, or at least progress on cause research sometime soon. But last month, whilst trying to review my career, I decided to look into this topic, and, oh boy, there just appears to be a massive gaping hole. I really don’t think it is happening.
I don’t particularly want to shift my career to do cause prioritisation research right now. So I am writing this piece in the hope that I can either have you, my dear reader, persuade me this work is not of utmost importance,},

	abstract = {This post is written by Marius Hobbhahn and Dominik Hermle. Both authors have contributed equally. It is a cross-post from my personal blog.
Chronic pain is one of the major causes of suffering within medicine. Its prevalence has been steadily increasing in recent years and it has caused millions of patients great pain, emotional distress and functional disability. What makes chronic pain so special is that a symptom develops into a disease. Normally pain highlights a functional impairment or damage of organ tissue. In chronic pain, however, this is different. Through molecular processes, neuronal restructuring, and cognitive and behavioral mechanisms pain persists even after when the physical condition is healed. In contrast to other less painful diseases (e.g. diabetes, wheelchair, prosthetic limb) patients don’t seem to get used to their condition. Once developed chronic pain is constantly present for a long, potentially lifelong, period of time. It can range from mild pain (e.g. tickling sensations on feet and hands) to conditions that are rated a 10/10 on the pain scale, such as (e.g. cluster headaches and trigeminal neuralgia). Given that chronic pain creates a lot of suffering and its prevalence is rising, we think it’s worth asking whether it should be a cause area for Effective Altruists.
In the following, we will try to give a more precise overview of what chronic pain is, whether it correlates with specific demographic factors such as age, regionality, fitness, income, etc., and lastly discuss whether it could be a worthy cause area. If you think we have made mistakes in our analysis or ignored important facts, don’t hesitate to contact us. Even though one of us studies medicine we want to stress that we are not experts in the field of chronic pain.
We are not the first to address the issue of (chronic) pain within the {EA} community. The Organisation for the prevention of intense suffering ({OPIS}), for example, makes a strong case for more access to medication for pain relief and effective treatment of very pain-intense diseases such as cluster headaches. Our research is supposed to be complementary to their mission and it is possible that {OPIS} has already compiled similar resources internally. There are two other {EA} forum posts on specific interventions on pain medication for developing countries and cluster headaches. Furthermore, there is a report on pain by the happier lives institute. However, to our knowledge, a high-level evaluation of chronic pain ({CP}) as a cause area is not yet publicly available.},

	abstract = {All of the following are my own estimates, people interested in working on the topic should do further research.
I think there is some unused space in the overlap of {EA} and {GMOs} and specifically golden rice. However, I think it's implausible that it is nearly as effective as the {GiveWell} top charities. This mainly comes from the fact that supplements and other alternatives seem to have already solved the problem to the largest extent.Scope: about 25,000 people die of {VAD} annually. This is much smaller than e.g. the 500,000 thousand people dying of Malaria per year.Tractability is high and comparable to {AMF}’s bednets for some interventions, e.g. we can run random control trials ({RCTs}) by giving some villages golden rice but not others. There are also less tractable interventions such as influencing governments’ stance on {GMOs}.Solving {VAD} through golden rice seems harder than solving Malaria through bednets because you not only have to think about logistics and funds but also have to sway the public’s and lawmakers’ opinion on {GMOs}. My rough guess is that even in the best case, working on golden rice would still be 2x less efficient than the {AMF} (see conclusion; intuitive estimate, no quantitative model).While golden rice might not match {AMF} levels of efficiency, there could probably still be some {EA}-aligned organizations working on using {GMOs} to fight malnutrition. The upside of saving lives with such simple products is just too large for {EAs} to entirely ignore. These organizations could work {onCooperating} with local organizations to lobby developing countries’ governments.Cooperating with local environmentalist groups and farmer alliances to reduce their opposition to {GMOs}.Working on distribution in countries that legalized golden rice, e.g. the Philippines and soon Bangladesh.Reducing the legal burdens of {GMOs} around the world to increase innovation more broadly.Working on new {GMOs} to solve different kinds of malnutrition.If you want to dig further into this, I would recommend contacting the golden rice project. Also, some {EA} organizations such as the good food institute, Open Phil, rethink priorities, charity entrepreneurship and others might have thoughts, recommendations, or funding.},

	abstract = {When thinking on boosting global health through better diets, one might think on tackling hunger or malnutrition. And unfortunately hunger and malnutrition are still huge problems worth working on. I will try to focus on dietary habits. The effects of people making unhealthy food choices. Although basically everyone knows that a poor diet is “somehow bad”, there is emerging evidence on “how bad”. The average diet is too high in sodium and too low in whole grains, fruits, nuts and seeds etc. This reduces expected lifespan by many years and greatly reduces expected life quality. The effects seem to be higher than the effects of all mental illnesses or the effects of alcohol- and tobacco- consumption combined. Furthermore, these effects are putting a heavy burden on society through direct and indirect costs.
In most studies the effects of hunger, hidden hunger, malnutrition and bad food choices are mixed up. And there are different definitions of all these concepts. It is hard (at least for me) to present good data on the precise amount of the problem of "dietary habits" as subproblem of diets in general. But nourishment (hunger, hidden hunger, malnutrition, food choices etc.) is such a huge problem that even if dietary habits make up "only" a third of it one should consider these habits as a goal by itself.  Tackling it needs different approaches.},

I decided to do some analysis to gain insight on the impact of economic growth on meat consumption in the developing world, which has occasionally been discussed in the past.
First I took the finding of York and Gossard (2004) that for every \$1,000 increase in per capita {PPP} {GDP}, African countries consume 1.66 kg more meat per person per year.1 For some perspective on the significance of that difference in {GDP}, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_GDP\_\%28PPP\%29\_per\_capita.},

Adolescence comes with substantial suffering for a large fraction of humanity.While we accept this suffering as normal and perhaps necessary, our perception might change in the coming decades or centuries.Impact: Taking published data on life satisfaction scores during adolescence seriously, “solving” adolescents’ suffering might well be cost-effective up to a cost of one trillion dollars.Tractability: We do not have simple and/or highly effective strategies to tackle the problem.Ideas might come from a societal angle (improving factors that alleviate adolescents’ suffering), group dynamics angle (reducing school bullying and cyberbullying), or individual angle (understanding the developmental factors underlying puberty).Neglectedness: Existing trends (overall improving the quality of life) and initiatives (anti-bullying) could “solve” adolescents’ suffering in due time.The basic research on the neuroscience of suffering during adolescence appears neglected and could be accelerated.Due to the considerable uncertainty in my analysis, I do not recommend any particular course of action beyond “more research desirable”.},

	abstract = {The case for Wikipedia editing in a nutshell: Wikipedia articles are widely read and trusted, there is much low hanging fruit for improvement, and editing Wikipedia has low barriers to entry and is relatively low effort. Consequently, improving a Wikipedia article may benefit the reasoning and actions of its thousands, and often millions, of readers. Moreover, since Wikipedia is a global public good, improvements to Wikipedia are likely undersupplied relative to the socially optimal level.Careful prioritisation is crucial. Improving or creating some Wikipedia articles could easily be 100x to 1,000x as valuable as others. The key factors to consider for prioritisation are (i) pageviews, (ii) audience, (iii) topic, (iv) room for improvement, and (v) language.Respecting Wikipedia community rules and norms is key. The Wikipedia community is wary of people making edits to promote a particular idea, person, or organisation, especially when there are relevant conflicts of interest. Consequently, edits that violate Wikipedia rules and norms may be actively harmful and are likely to be deleted. However, there are currently still very many genuine gaps in the quality and coverage of Wikipedia articles, and filling these gaps tends to work well and is regarded highly.Contributing to or starting a {WikiProject} on an important topic may be valuable. A {WikiProject} is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve Wikipedia. A {WikiProject} allows for more efficient collaboration, by providing a centralised place where interested editors can make plans and discuss proposals.There are self-interested reasons to edit Wikipedia. In particular, Wikipedia editing can be really fun, it is a great opportunity to learn more about a topic, it may help you improve your writing, and it may be a useful signal in some communities or for some professional opportunities.Some {EA}-relevant content is better suited to a specialised {EA} Wiki than to Wikipedia.

This allows for things to be done when it creates more value for everybody than it destroys, and prevents things from destroying more value than they create. Money also allows for one person to be paid money for a large, complex service, and then for that same person to redirect parts of that money to induce other people to do smaller parts of the bigger task, allowing for coordination of large, complex tasks. This view is largely correct, and an important fact that among the general population is often missed.},

	abstract = {This is a comprehensive critical summary of Thomas Metzinger's recent paper, Artificial Suffering: An Argument for a Global Moratorium on Synthetic Phenomenology. He thinks it's our moral duty to minimize {ENP} risk: the risk of an 'explosion of negative phenomenology' tied to conscious awareness in future machines. Metzinger is a professor of philosophy at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and is notable for developing a theory of consciousness called the self-model theory of subjectivity. He recently served on the European Commission’s high-level expert group on artificial intelligence. Metzinger's argument has deep implications for the ways {EA} and {EA}-adjacent groups think about s-risks, {AI} research, and whole brain emulation (e.g. Karnofsky's digital people or Hanson's ems).
In this post, I will summarize Metzinger's argument, define common terminology in the consciousness literature, and make some brief comments at the end. Metzinger subscribes to some version of suffering-focused ethics, but the argument still holds in most broadly consequentialist ethical theories.},

	abstract = {Doing Good Better is a superb book, and probably remains the best book-length introduction to effective altruism. But in part because the book did so much to grow {EA}, the movement has outgrown the book. This is neither a surprise nor a mark against the book — nearly 7 years have passed since it was published.
In particular, the book came before {AI} alignment, existential risks, and longtermism really emerged as key threads in {EA} thinking, so the experience of reading the book and then getting up to speed with cutting-edge {EA} could be jarring; even confusing.[14] The issue isn't simply that longtermism happened — the community itself has properly grown up since 2015, along with a constellation of organisations, ideas, cause areas, and cause area candidates. If your aim is to excite people about getting involved with {EA}, failing to describe all the exciting stuff which has happened in the past 5 years would be to miss a wide-open goal.
What should a new introduction to {EA} look like? Well, I'm confident that it shouldn't look like a redo of Doing Good Better (Doing Doing Good Better better...) One cool version could be a whirlwind survey of organisations and concepts, where the aim is just to blow the reader's mind as efficiently as possible. Or it could in fact be multiple books, where the arguments and framings in each are more specifically tested and optimised for specific audiences; such as high school kids looking for inspiration about what to do with their lives.
I also happen to think this is unusually important to get right, since the reputation of the book would be difficult to separate from {EA}'s overall reputation. So I think a lot of care should be taken in writing it, and likely the idea should be entrusted to someone with a track record as a communicator.},

	langid = {english},
	abstract = {There has been much discussion in the {EA} community lately of a “funding overhang” where there is more effective altruist money to spend than {EA} uses to spend it on.
As a nonprofit employee of 1Day Sooner whose salary is largely paid by various members of the {EA} community, the prospect of a funding overhang sounds too good to be true, but insofar as it does exist, I’d like to argue that a fair amount of this decade’s portion should be spent developing and deploying vaccines against infectious diseases.
Millions of deaths each year are caused by tuberculosis (1.4M), Group A Strep (500K), malaria (400K), influenza (300K), hepatitis C (300K),  shigella (200K), and respiratory syncytial virus (160K). On certain reasonable assumptions, I’d argue they can absorb billions of dollars in {GiveWell}-charity equivalent funding over the next ten years. Beyond the object-level of saving millions of lives, developing effective vaccines to major diseases would benefit pandemic preparedness and {EA}’s political reputation in a way that could reduce existential risks long-term.
My expertise on vaccine development is at best incomplete, and I am biased because 1Day Sooner is raising money to work in this area. But the scale of the problem is large, multiple reasonable strategies exist to help address it, the timing is opportune, and the approach usefully diversifies {EA} funding strategies while complementing other long-term {EA} goals.
Tl;dr: If {EA}’s investing \$10 billion in vaccination over the next ten years could save the equivalent of 3-5 years of disease burden of a disease like tuberculosis, it would represent a cost per disability-adjusted-life-year ({DALY}) saved of roughly \$50-\$85 (on par with {GiveWell} top charities). There are plausible mechanisms available to accomplish this, such as advanced market commitments, challenge studies, systems immunology research, and subsidizing {mRNA} vaccine manufacturing capacity. The effective altruism movement should quickly begin investigating this area more thoroughly and consider developing funding mechanisms commensurate with the scale of the opportunity.
Epistemic Status:I feel this makes a decent but simplistic default case that merits mild confidence in the absence of refutation (which I encourage people to do so as to sharpen the analysis).

Big Problem: Infectious disease is a big enough problem that a number of {GiveWell}’s top charities (e.g. Against Malaria Foundation and the {END} Fund) focus on mitigating its impact. Developing and deploying vaccines can dramatically reduce disease incidence in the long-run.
To give a sense of scale, here are the {DALY}’s lost annually to some vaccine-preventable diseases.
Annual {DALYs} Lost to Certain Infectious Diseases and Disease Categories (in millions) {HIV}/{AIDS}66.7Malaria55.8Tuberculosis40.3Hepatitis C12.6Typhoid10.6Group A Strep10.5Schistosomiasis3.4Dengue1.1Diarrheal Disease71.5Upper Respiratory Infection2.9Lower Respiratory Infection103
Per this workshop on Group A Strep, an accelerated vaccine development schedule for a disease might typically take about eight years with a further eight years for global deployment. It estimates a more traditional development process at 13 years and deployment at 15-20 years thereafter.
If {GiveWell} charities buy a {DALY} at \$80, it would be worth it to invest (for example) \$3.2 billion to eliminate a single year of tuberculosis disease burden.

Theory of change and mental models of world: Weak to moderate

Importance of stylometrics research if above theories are correct: Moderate to
strong

Basically I just wanted to write about stylometrics but then I tried to argue
its importance, and realised that understanding its importance requires
accepting a much larger set of assumptions. I won't fully defend all of these
assumptions, but I think they're mostly important to think about and ideally
deserve separate posts.

{KEY} {HYPOTHESIS}
- Surveillance tech is becoming more powerful and more widespread. {AI} is
enabling automation of the entire pipeline from data collection to analysis to
its usage in offensive actions such as blackmail. Automation allows such
operations to scale up to large sets of targets.

- Surveillance tech stabilises totalitarian regimes and destabilises democratic
ones.

- Advocates of decentralised technology and privacy-preserving technology have
ambitious plans of building an unsurveillable society.

- This dream is sufficiently ambitious and requires so many different things to
go right that it may be worth analysing through the lens of impossibility
results. This means trying to identify the most difficult challenges such
technology faces, and proving results on things it cannot do no matter how hard
it tries.

- {AI} for stylometrics could provide one such impossibility result. Stylometrics
is the study of linguistic style. In this post it is being used primarily in the
context of doxxing anonymous individuals.

{SURVEILLANCE} {TECH} {IS} {BECOMING} {MORE} {POWERFUL} {AND} {MORE} {WIDESPREAD}
Here's a shortened version of some of the claims from The Global Expansion of {AI}
Surveillance by Steven Feldstein, Carnegie Endowment:

- {AI} surveillance technology is spreading at a faster rate to a wider range of
countries than experts have commonly understood. At least seventy-five out of
176 countries globally are actively using {AI} technologies for surveillance
purposes.

- China is a major driv},

Abject poverty in the world is declining. Both the number of people and, of course, the percentage of the world’s population living in poverty is declining at a rate never seen in history. This is great news.But the sheer number of people getting by on \$2.50 a day or less remains staggering. It’s over 3 billion people.While many organizations perform invaluable work attempting to address this problem, one of the more overlooked sources of poverty in the developing world is price risk. There are, of course, plenty of risks for the small farmer, but price risk adds to the overall burden.},

My experiences at four research universities and as a National Institutes of Health ({NIH}) research fellow taught me that the relentless pursuit of taxpayer funding has eliminated curiosity, basic competence, and scientific integrity in many fields.Yet, more importantly, training in “science” is now tantamount to grant-writing and learning how to obtain funding. Organized skepticism, critical thinking, and methodological rigor, if present at all, are afterthoughts.

From 1970 to 2010, as taxpayer funding for public health research increased 700 percent, the number of retractions of biomedical research articles increased more than 900 percent, with most due to misconduct.

The widespread inability of publicly funded researchers to generate valid, reproducible findings is a testament to the failure of universities to properly train scientists and instill intellectual and methodologic rigor.

academic research is often “conducted for no other reason than to give physicians and researchers qualifications for promotion or tenure.” In other words, taxpayers fund studies that are conducted for non-scientific reasons such as career advancement

Incompetence in concert with a lack of accountability and political or personal agendas has grave consequences:  *The Economist*  stated that from 2000 to 2010, nearly 80,000 patients were involved in clinical trials based on research that was later retracted.
Still, there the author says there is hope for reform. The last three paragraphs suggest abolishing overheads, have limits on the number of grants received by and the maximum age of {PIs}, and preventing the use of public funding for publicity.},

Below is a paper about to be submitted. The focus is on interventions that could improve the long-term outcome given catastrophes that disrupt electricity/industry, such as solar storm, high-altitude electromagnetic pulse ({HEMP}), narrow {AI} computer virus, and extreme pandemic. Work on these interventions is even more neglected than interventions for feeding everyone if the sun is blocked. Cost-effectiveness is compared to a slightly modified {AGI} safety cost-effectiveness model posted earlier on the {EA} forum. Two different cost-effectiveness estimates for losing industry interventions were developed: one by Denkenberger and a poll at {EA} Global San Francisco 2018, and the other by Anders Sandberg at Future of Humanity Institute. There is great uncertainty in both {AGI} safety and interventions for losing industry. However, the models have  {\textasciitilde}99\% confidence that funding interventions for losing industry now is more cost effective than additional funding for {AGI} safety beyond the expected {\textasciitilde}\$3 billion. This does not take into account model or theory uncertainty, so the confidence would likely decrease. However, in order to make {AGI} safety more cost effective, this required changing four variables in the Sandberg model to the 5th percentile on the pessimistic end simultaneously. For the other model, it required changing seven variables. Therefore, it is quite robust that a significant amount of money should be invested in losing industry interventions now. There is closer to 50\%-88\% confidence that spending the {\textasciitilde}\$40 million on interventions for losing industry is more cost effective than {AGI} safety. Overall, {AGI} safety is more important and more total money should be spent on it. The modeling concludes that additional funding would be justified on both causes even for the present generation.},

@online{Vivalt2020ForecastingResearchResults,
	abstract = {Eva Vivalt, a researcher at the Australian National University, believes “there's a whole wealth of [hidden] information that people use to come to certain decisions or beliefs.” With this in mind, she is helping to build a platform to collect that information — specifically, people’s predictions about the results of social science experiments. In this talk, she discusses what social science stands to gain through the use of forecasting, from better research design to less biased decisions about which studies to publish.Below is a transcript of Eva’s talk, which we have lightly edited for clarity. You can also watch the talk on {YouTube} or read it on effectivealtruism.org.
I'm very excited to be presenting on predicting results in the social sciences. I have a thought experiment for you. Suppose you're a policymaker and you're trying to decide which of two programs to support: cash transfers or a school meals program.

Your goal is to improve enrollment rates in school. This is a bit of an unusual example because we have a lot of randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) on both of those program types, so it is a best-case scenario. Nonetheless, you may think that results are going to be different in your particular context. And even in the unlikely event that you do have an {RCT} for your particular context, it’s from the past; your current situation is still going to be different. I don’t need to go into external validity too much, but essentially, researchers worry that existing studies may not be perfectly informative. The results may not extrapolate very well from one setting to another. In some past work, I've found that if you use a database of existing impact evaluations to try to predict the effect of a particular study, you can expect to be off by more than 100\%. So the effect is X, plus or minus X. That's not very encouraging. What can we do in this situation? Well, some of my collaborators, Stefano {DellaVigna} and Devin Pope, ran an experiment on Amazon's Mechanical Turk in which they asked people to press letters on their keyboards — A, B, A, B, A, B — as fast as they could for 10 minutes. They incentivized participants using different kinds of schemes.},

	abstract = {In 2011 I came across Giving What We Can, which shortly blossomed into effective altruism. Call me a geek if you like but I found it exciting, like really exciting. Here were people thinking super carefully about the most effective ways to have an impact, to create change, to build a better world. Suddenly a boundless opportunity to do vast amounts of good opened up before my eyes. I had only just got involved and by giving to fund bednets and had already magnified my impact on the world 100 times.
And this was just the beginning. Obviously bednets were not the most effective charitable intervention, they were just the most effective we had found to date – with just a tiny amount of research. Imagine what topic could be explored next: the long run effects of interventions, economic growth, political change, geopolitics, conflict studies, etc. We could work out how to compare charities of vastly different cause areas, or how to do good beyond donations (some people were already starting to talk about career choices). Some people said we should care about animals (or {AI} risk), I didn’t buy it (back then), but imagine, we could work out what different value sets lead to different causes and the best charities for each.
As far as I could tell the whole field of optimising for impact seemed vastly under-explored. This wasn’t too surprising – most people don’t seem to care that much about doing charitable giving well and anyway it was only just coming to light how truly bad our intuitions were at making charitable choices (with the early 2000’s aid skepticism movement).
Looking back, I was optimistic. Yet in some regards my optimism was well-placed. In terms of spreading ideas, my small group of geeky uni friends went on to create something remarkable, to shift £m if not £bn of donations to better causes, to help 1000s maybe 100,000s of people make better career decisions. I am no longer surprised if a colleague, tinder date or complete stranger has heard of effective altruism ({EA}) or gives money to {AMF} (a bednet charity).
However, in terms of the research I was so excited about, of developing the field of how to do good, there has been minimal progress. After nearly a decade, bednets and {AI} research still seem to be at the top of everyone’s Christmas donations wish list. I think I assumed that someone had got this covered, that {GPI} or {FHI} or whoever will have answers, or at least progress on cause research sometime soon. But last month, whilst trying to review my career, I decided to look into this topic, and, oh boy, there just appears to be a massive gaping hole. I really don’t think it is happening.
I don’t particularly want to shift my career to do cause prioritisation research right now. So I am writing this piece in the hope that I can either have you, my dear reader, persuade me this work is not of utmost importance,},

But there's also a low-certainty, high-reward approach: promote catch-up economic growth. Poverty is strongly correlated with economic development (urbanization, industrialization, etc), so encouraging development would have large effects on poverty. Whereas cash transfers have a large probability of a small effect, promoting  growth has a small probability of a large effect. (In general, we should diversify across high- and low-risk strategies.)
