	abstract = {This is the third post on research exploring the interventions to improve the lives of urban wild vertebrate animals in South African cities. We are grateful for the support of a grant from {EA} Animal Welfare Fund. The aim of this post is to catalogue existing methods for managing the population of Cape chacma baboons living in the Cape peninsula, with a focus on welfare impacts for the baboons. Where appropriate, we indicate which existing methods might be prioritised or modified, to improve baboons’ welfare. Since urban baboon populations are not widespread globally, many of these insights are particular to the local context. However, some insights may be generalised to contexts where urban wildlife populations share certain characteristics with the Cape chacma baboon.
Relative to more numerous urban wild animal populations considered “pests” (e.g. rats and pigeons), we think that the importance of interventions to improve welfare of Cape baboons is low. Recent data (in the past {\textasciitilde}5 years) indicates that annual baboon deaths are relatively low (and have been decreasing). The baboon population seems to be stabilizing around a suggested carrying capacity of {\textasciitilde}480 baboons. Fewer baboons die from (direct or indirect) human causes than from natural causes (including infanticide).
Neglectedness is also relatively low compared to rats and pigeons. The problem seems relatively well-recognised and researched. The City of Cape Town has devoted resources to the existing Urban Baboon Programme (see below), which seems to have been fairly effective at keeping baboons out of urban areas. The issue has received research and media attention.
Nevertheless, Cape baboon welfare matters, and efforts to improve their welfare are worthwhile. Improving their welfare seems relatively tractable, e.g. there seems to be reasonably broad “buy in” for humane methods of keeping humans and baboons separate.},

@online{Altman2022CauseProfileCognitive,
	abstract = {This post is a first attempt at analysing cognitive enhancement research using the {ITN} framework and cost-effectiveness estimates. Several interventions enhance cognitive functions such as intelligence and decision making. If we identify effective, cheap and scalable cognitive enhancement interventions, they may be competitive with {GiveWell} charities.
In the long term, cognitive enhancement may act as an accelerator for technological development. There are concerns that this rapid development could increase the ability of small groups to cause harm and therefore increase anthropogenic existential risk. However, improved decision making in the long term would be desirable.
The two barriers to tractability are poor coordination in the research field and regulatory barriers to licensing medications. Current developments in cognitive enhancement have happened mainly as byproducts of other research fields. It lacks a cohesive scientific community. There are no apparent evolutionary barriers to solvability. However, there are significant regulatory barriers as new medicines must be licensed to treat a specific medical condition.
Cognitive enhancement research is neglected in comparison to similar fields. There is considerable uncertainty around funding from non-public, pharmaceutical and government sources. Overall, there may be impactful funding opportunities for effective altruists in cognitive enhancement research.},

	abstract = {Agricultural land redistribution is a type of agrarian reform in which large farms are broken up and distributed to tenants or landless peasants.
Land redistribution typically requires exceptional circumstances to succeed. Past redistributive efforts have been most successful in the aftermath of revolution, war, or independence.
When redistribution has succeeded, it has been accompanied by extensive agricultural support, such as rural infrastructure development, subsidies for fertilizers and high-yield seeds, agronomic training, and cheap credit.
The main value of redistribution appears to be improved agricultural yields, but redistribution is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for improved yields.
The exact mechanism by which redistribution improves yields is unclear. Redistribution creates smaller farms, and there’s some evidence that smaller farms have higher yields. (A common theory to explain this is that small landowners face better incentives than landless tenants, so they provide more labor and invest more in improving yield.) However, it’s also possible that redistribution in isolation provides little benefit to yields. Recent evidence suggests either a U-shaped or flat relationship between yields and farm size, suggesting that consolidation could be as attractive an option (for improving yields) as redistribution.
There appear to be no large and reputable {NGOs} that advocate for radical land redistribution. {NGOs} that promote tenure reform (another type of land reform) might be convinced to advocate for redistribution.
Our weakly held belief is that South Asia is the best region to pursue land redistribution.
We believe that advocating for agricultural land redistribution is unlikely to be a cost-effective intervention and very intractable.},

This post gives an overview of the issue in four parts: the neglectedness of fish welfare in general, the number of cleaner fish stocked in salmon farms and the reasons for this, the welfare issues cleaner fish endure, and suggestions for what can be done about this problem. Most data is from Norway, the world's largest producer of farmed salmon. Key takeaways:
Despite strong evidence for fishes' capacity to suffer, their welfare has long been neglected by both fishing industries and animal advocates.Sea lice is a big problem in salmonid farming, and after lice have become increasingly resistant to chemical treatment, other delousing methods have been employed, the least harmful to salmon of these being cleaner fish.Cleaner fish are not adapted to the environment that salmon live in and face disease and high mortality rates. There are also many problems with the way they are treated by the Norwegian cleaner fish and salmon industries.The evidence of cleaner fishes' effectiveness at delousing salmon is sparse, and it is argued that it is not adequate to justify the widespread use of cleaner fish.Suggested interventions are corporate outreach to improve cleaner fish welfare, or to end the use of cleaner fish entirely, as well as working on shifting the public opinions about fishes' welfare and moral value.},

	abstract = {Toby Ord didn’t start his career thinking about the far future. When the Oxford philosopher created the organization Giving What We Can ({GWWC}) in 2009, it focused on finding the most cost-effective charities for saving or improving lives today, like malaria bed nets, and encouraging members to pledge 10 percent of their income to those charities. This marked the beginning of the movement known as effective altruism ({EA}), which describes itself as “about using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis.”
Thirty-seven years before Ord created the {EA} movement, Princeton philosopher Peter Singer formed the ideas that now underpin it. In his 1972 essay, Famine, Affluence, and Morality, Singer offered the following thought experiment:

...if I am walking past a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to wade in and pull the child out. This will mean getting my clothes muddy, but this is insignificant, while the death of the child would presumably be a bad thing...It makes no moral difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor’s child ten yards from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away.

Singer taught, as {EA} now does, to look beyond one’s immediate circle to humanity as a whole when weighing how to do good. If saving a drowning child in front of you is worth some sacrifice, it must be worth the same sacrifice to save an out-of-view child from perishing, as well.
But what if the metaphorical drowning child, rather than being 10,000 miles away, is 10,000 years in the future? This is the question Ord explores in his 2020 book, The Precipice. The risks he considers are not children dying from preventable disease, but of children never being born at all—not hundreds or thousands of children, but billions or trillions of them throughout humanity’s vast potential future. Whether our species can end suffering, explore other worlds, and experience the unimaginable, all depends on whether we can survive to continue our story.
Ord argues that we may be living through the most important time in history, when our technological power is growing so rapidly that we could make humanity’s final mistake. Climate change, nuclear war, pandemics, or unaligned artificial intelligence could all spell the end of humanity if we’re not careful. The extremely high stakes of safeguarding humanity’s future potential makes it worth fighting for, even if the probability of catastrophe is low—and in estimating its odds at 1 in 6, Ord doesn’t believe it to be so low. He brought his optimism from addressing global poverty, identifying specific ways that individuals can help, not just by donating to effective organizations working to minimize existential risks, but also by directing their own careers to make the biggest difference.

	abstract = {I allocated just under £30k of my 2021 giving to improving {UK} housing policy and plan to give more in 2022.
{TL};{DR} of my case for this:
It seems plausible that better housing policy could boost the {UK}'s {GDP} by more than a fifth, with all the attendant benefits of extra economic growth.The current government has some interest in doing this, but needs more pressure to do it and good policy ideas for how to do it.There are a couple of organisations I think are doing particularly good work in this area in that they're focusing on what I think the key problem is (housing supply) and have good ideas for how to solve the problem.I think that a few tens of thousands of pounds could make a big difference here
We should have a high bar for funding interventions to help people in rich countries in the short to medium term. Being wealthy, their citizens can afford much higher rates of consumption and their governments can spend at much higher rates, so many of their strongest needs are met. Giving money directly to these relatively wealthy people is not as effective as giving to people who are roughly x100 poorer. Further, there are interventions {\textasciitilde} x10 as good as giving money to these poorer people. This leads to Open Philanthropy arguing that {EA} interventions in rich countries should seek to meet the x1000 bar.
It is difficult to find causes that meet this standard (though the x100 bar for simple cash transfers is easier to meet and arguably more relevant for the long term).
I think changing housing policy in rich countries is a plausible cause that meets this bar, particularly in areas with the highest costs of housing and highest productivity. Here is a rough cost-effectiveness model that suggests housing policy could meet the bar.
I think that the {UK}’s housing policy is among the worst of all rich countries, and to date has not received the funding or attention that {US} housing policy has. Founders Pledge commissioned a great report on this area, focussing on the {UK}. In contrast, Open Philanthropy has already put several million dollars into funding this cause in the {US}.},

Research may help us assess which actions will most cost-effectively make progress. Tentatively, we argue that outreach on this topic should first focus on researchers and other stakeholders who have adjacent interests.
Imagine that you develop a brain disease like Alzheimer’s, but that a cutting-edge treatment has been developed. Doctors replace the damaged neurons in your brain with computer chips that are functionally identical to healthy neurons. After your first treatment that replaces just a few thousand neurons, you feel no different. As your condition deteriorates, the treatments proceed and, eventually, the final biological neuron in your brain is replaced. Still, you feel, think, and act exactly as you did before. It seems that you are as sentient as you were before. Your friends and family would probably still care about you, even though your brain is now entirely artificial.[1]
This thought experiment suggests that artificial sentience ({AS}) is possible[2] and that artificial entities, at least those as sophisticated as humans, could warrant moral consideration. Many scholars seem to agree.[3]},

This document sets out:
What populism is, what its impacts and causes are, and who is working on this cause {alreadyWhat} a philanthropist could do to tackle the problem
Our analysis informed our ranking of which broad causes are specifically effective to decrease populism, which is based on qualitative subjective impressions. We concluded that improving rationality, institutional decision making and evidence-based policy are particularly promising.

This should just be seen as a rough guide towards finding potentially highly effective interventions.
Throughout the report we highlight concrete ideas of things that a philanthropist could fund. We distinguish between “funding ideas”, which are promising broad areas that could be explored further, and “funding opportunities”, which are a bit more concrete because we have found a non-profit or academic researcher that is already working on a very promising idea or project that seem plausibly highly effective and that could be funded in the very near term. Our rough ranking of promising funding opportunities is as follows:

For instance, our top choice is the Initiative on Global Markets ({IGM}), a research center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Specifically, their “Economics Experts Panel”, regularly polls top economists on economic policy questions. A philanthropist could fund this project so that it can be expanded. Basing economic policy on expert consensus should be robustly positive.},

	abstract = {In 2011 I came across Giving What We Can, which shortly blossomed into effective altruism. Call me a geek if you like but I found it exciting, like really exciting. Here were people thinking super carefully about the most effective ways to have an impact, to create change, to build a better world. Suddenly a boundless opportunity to do vast amounts of good opened up before my eyes. I had only just got involved and by giving to fund bednets and had already magnified my impact on the world 100 times.
And this was just the beginning. Obviously bednets were not the most effective charitable intervention, they were just the most effective we had found to date – with just a tiny amount of research. Imagine what topic could be explored next: the long run effects of interventions, economic growth, political change, geopolitics, conflict studies, etc. We could work out how to compare charities of vastly different cause areas, or how to do good beyond donations (some people were already starting to talk about career choices). Some people said we should care about animals (or {AI} risk), I didn’t buy it (back then), but imagine, we could work out what different value sets lead to different causes and the best charities for each.
As far as I could tell the whole field of optimising for impact seemed vastly under-explored. This wasn’t too surprising – most people don’t seem to care that much about doing charitable giving well and anyway it was only just coming to light how truly bad our intuitions were at making charitable choices (with the early 2000’s aid skepticism movement).
Looking back, I was optimistic. Yet in some regards my optimism was well-placed. In terms of spreading ideas, my small group of geeky uni friends went on to create something remarkable, to shift £m if not £bn of donations to better causes, to help 1000s maybe 100,000s of people make better career decisions. I am no longer surprised if a colleague, tinder date or complete stranger has heard of effective altruism ({EA}) or gives money to {AMF} (a bednet charity).
However, in terms of the research I was so excited about, of developing the field of how to do good, there has been minimal progress. After nearly a decade, bednets and {AI} research still seem to be at the top of everyone’s Christmas donations wish list. I think I assumed that someone had got this covered, that {GPI} or {FHI} or whoever will have answers, or at least progress on cause research sometime soon. But last month, whilst trying to review my career, I decided to look into this topic, and, oh boy, there just appears to be a massive gaping hole. I really don’t think it is happening.
I don’t particularly want to shift my career to do cause prioritisation research right now. So I am writing this piece in the hope that I can either have you, my dear reader, persuade me this work is not of utmost importance,},

@online{Hobbhahn2021ShouldChronicPain,
	langid = {english},
	abstract = {This post is written by Marius Hobbhahn and Dominik Hermle. Both authors have contributed equally. It is a cross-post from my personal blog.
Chronic pain is one of the major causes of suffering within medicine. Its prevalence has been steadily increasing in recent years and it has caused millions of patients great pain, emotional distress and functional disability. What makes chronic pain so special is that a symptom develops into a disease. Normally pain highlights a functional impairment or damage of organ tissue. In chronic pain, however, this is different. Through molecular processes, neuronal restructuring, and cognitive and behavioral mechanisms pain persists even after when the physical condition is healed. In contrast to other less painful diseases (e.g. diabetes, wheelchair, prosthetic limb) patients don’t seem to get used to their condition. Once developed chronic pain is constantly present for a long, potentially lifelong, period of time. It can range from mild pain (e.g. tickling sensations on feet and hands) to conditions that are rated a 10/10 on the pain scale, such as (e.g. cluster headaches and trigeminal neuralgia). Given that chronic pain creates a lot of suffering and its prevalence is rising, we think it’s worth asking whether it should be a cause area for Effective Altruists.
In the following, we will try to give a more precise overview of what chronic pain is, whether it correlates with specific demographic factors such as age, regionality, fitness, income, etc., and lastly discuss whether it could be a worthy cause area. If you think we have made mistakes in our analysis or ignored important facts, don’t hesitate to contact us. Even though one of us studies medicine we want to stress that we are not experts in the field of chronic pain.
We are not the first to address the issue of (chronic) pain within the {EA} community. The Organisation for the prevention of intense suffering ({OPIS}), for example, makes a strong case for more access to medication for pain relief and effective treatment of very pain-intense diseases such as cluster headaches. Our research is supposed to be complementary to their mission and it is possible that {OPIS} has already compiled similar resources internally. There are two other {EA} forum posts on specific interventions on pain medication for developing countries and cluster headaches. Furthermore, there is a report on pain by the happier lives institute. However, to our knowledge, a high-level evaluation of chronic pain ({CP}) as a cause area is not yet publicly available.},

I think there is some unused space in the overlap of {EA} and {GMOs} and specifically golden rice. However, I think it's implausible that it is nearly as effective as the {GiveWell} top charities. This mainly comes from the fact that supplements and other alternatives seem to have already solved the problem to the largest extent.Scope: about 25,000 people die of {VAD} annually. This is much smaller than e.g. the 500,000 thousand people dying of Malaria per year.Tractability is high and comparable to {AMF}’s bednets for some interventions, e.g. we can run random control trials ({RCTs}) by giving some villages golden rice but not others. There are also less tractable interventions such as influencing governments’ stance on {GMOs}.Solving {VAD} through golden rice seems harder than solving Malaria through bednets because you not only have to think about logistics and funds but also have to sway the public’s and lawmakers’ opinion on {GMOs}. My rough guess is that even in the best case, working on golden rice would still be 2x less efficient than the {AMF} (see conclusion; intuitive estimate, no quantitative model).While golden rice might not match {AMF} levels of efficiency, there could probably still be some {EA}-aligned organizations working on using {GMOs} to fight malnutrition. The upside of saving lives with such simple products is just too large for {EAs} to entirely ignore. These organizations could work {onCooperating} with local organizations to lobby developing countries’ governments.Cooperating with local environmentalist groups and farmer alliances to reduce their opposition to {GMOs}.Working on distribution in countries that legalized golden rice, e.g. the Philippines and soon Bangladesh.Reducing the legal burdens of {GMOs} around the world to increase innovation more broadly.Working on new {GMOs} to solve different kinds of malnutrition.If you want to dig further into this, I would recommend contacting the golden rice project. Also, some {EA} organizations such as the good food institute, Open Phil, rethink priorities, charity entrepreneurship and others might have thoughts, recommendations, or funding.},

@online{Janicki2021DietaryHabitsAnother,
	abstract = {When thinking on boosting global health through better diets, one might think on tackling hunger or malnutrition. And unfortunately hunger and malnutrition are still huge problems worth working on. I will try to focus on dietary habits. The effects of people making unhealthy food choices. Although basically everyone knows that a poor diet is “somehow bad”, there is emerging evidence on “how bad”. The average diet is too high in sodium and too low in whole grains, fruits, nuts and seeds etc. This reduces expected lifespan by many years and greatly reduces expected life quality. The effects seem to be higher than the effects of all mental illnesses or the effects of alcohol- and tobacco- consumption combined. Furthermore, these effects are putting a heavy burden on society through direct and indirect costs.
In most studies the effects of hunger, hidden hunger, malnutrition and bad food choices are mixed up. And there are different definitions of all these concepts. It is hard (at least for me) to present good data on the precise amount of the problem of "dietary habits" as subproblem of diets in general. But nourishment (hunger, hidden hunger, malnutrition, food choices etc.) is such a huge problem that even if dietary habits make up "only" a third of it one should consider these habits as a goal by itself.  Tackling it needs different approaches.},

This allows for things to be done when it creates more value for everybody than it destroys, and prevents things from destroying more value than they create. Money also allows for one person to be paid money for a large, complex service, and then for that same person to redirect parts of that money to induce other people to do smaller parts of the bigger task, allowing for coordination of large, complex tasks.

Metzinger is a professor of philosophy at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and is notable for developing a theory of consciousness called the self-model theory of subjectivity. He recently served on the European Commission’s high-level expert group on artificial intelligence. Metzinger's argument has deep implications for the ways {EA} and {EA}-adjacent groups think about s-risks, {AI} research, and whole brain emulation (e.g. Karnofsky's digital people or Hanson's ems).
In this post, I will summarize Metzinger's argument, define common terminology in the consciousness literature, and make some brief comments at the end.

	abstract = {Doing Good Better is a superb book, and probably remains the best book-length introduction to effective altruism. But in part because the book did so much to grow {EA}, the movement has outgrown the book. This is neither a surprise nor a mark against the book — nearly 7 years have passed since it was published.
In particular, the book came before {AI} alignment, existential risks, and longtermism really emerged as key threads in {EA} thinking, so the experience of reading the book and then getting up to speed with cutting-edge {EA} could be jarring; even confusing.[14] The issue isn't simply that longtermism happened — the community itself has properly grown up since 2015, along with a constellation of organisations, ideas, cause areas, and cause area candidates. If your aim is to excite people about getting involved with {EA}, failing to describe all the exciting stuff which has happened in the past 5 years would be to miss a wide-open goal.
What should a new introduction to {EA} look like? Well, I'm confident that it shouldn't look like a redo of Doing Good Better (Doing Doing Good Better better...) One cool version could be a whirlwind survey of organisations and concepts, where the aim is just to blow the reader's mind as efficiently as possible. Or it could in fact be multiple books, where the arguments and framings in each are more specifically tested and optimised for specific audiences; such as high school kids looking for inspiration about what to do with their lives.
I also happen to think this is unusually important to get right, since the reputation of the book would be difficult to separate from {EA}'s overall reputation. So I think a lot of care should be taken in writing it, and likely the idea should be entrusted to someone with a track record as a communicator.},

@online{Morrison2021EaShouldSpend,
	langid = {english},
	abstract = {There has been much discussion in the {EA} community lately of a “funding overhang” where there is more effective altruist money to spend than {EA} uses to spend it on.
As a nonprofit employee of 1Day Sooner whose salary is largely paid by various members of the {EA} community, the prospect of a funding overhang sounds too good to be true, but insofar as it does exist, I’d like to argue that a fair amount of this decade’s portion should be spent developing and deploying vaccines against infectious diseases.
Millions of deaths each year are caused by tuberculosis (1.4M), Group A Strep (500K), malaria (400K), influenza (300K), hepatitis C (300K),  shigella (200K), and respiratory syncytial virus (160K). On certain reasonable assumptions, I’d argue they can absorb billions of dollars in {GiveWell}-charity equivalent funding over the next ten years. Beyond the object-level of saving millions of lives, developing effective vaccines to major diseases would benefit pandemic preparedness and {EA}’s political reputation in a way that could reduce existential risks long-term.
My expertise on vaccine development is at best incomplete, and I am biased because 1Day Sooner is raising money to work in this area. But the scale of the problem is large, multiple reasonable strategies exist to help address it, the timing is opportune, and the approach usefully diversifies {EA} funding strategies while complementing other long-term {EA} goals.
Tl;dr: If {EA}’s investing \$10 billion in vaccination over the next ten years could save the equivalent of 3-5 years of disease burden of a disease like tuberculosis, it would represent a cost per disability-adjusted-life-year ({DALY}) saved of roughly \$50-\$85 (on par with {GiveWell} top charities). There are plausible mechanisms available to accomplish this, such as advanced market commitments, challenge studies, systems immunology research, and subsidizing {mRNA} vaccine manufacturing capacity. The effective altruism movement should quickly begin investigating this area more thoroughly and consider developing funding mechanisms commensurate with the scale of the opportunity.
Epistemic Status:I feel this makes a decent but simplistic default case that merits mild confidence in the absence of refutation (which I encourage people to do so as to sharpen the analysis).

Big Problem: Infectious disease is a big enough problem that a number of {GiveWell}’s top charities (e.g. Against Malaria Foundation and the {END} Fund) focus on mitigating its impact. Developing and deploying vaccines can dramatically reduce disease incidence in the long-run.
To give a sense of scale, here are the {DALY}’s lost annually to some vaccine-preventable diseases.
Annual {DALYs} Lost to Certain Infectious Diseases and Disease Categories (in millions) {HIV}/{AIDS}66.7Malaria55.8Tuberculosis40.3Hepatitis C12.6Typhoid10.6Group A Strep10.5Schistosomiasis3.4Dengue1.1Diarrheal Disease71.5Upper Respiratory Infection2.9Lower Respiratory Infection103
Per this workshop on Group A Strep, an accelerated vaccine development schedule for a disease might typically take about eight years with a further eight years for global deployment. It estimates a more traditional development process at 13 years and deployment at 15-20 years thereafter.
If {GiveWell} charities buy a {DALY} at \$80, it would be worth it to invest (for example) \$3.2 billion to eliminate a single year of tuberculosis disease burden.

Theory of change and mental models of world: Weak to moderate

Importance of stylometrics research if above theories are correct: Moderate to
strong

Basically I just wanted to write about stylometrics but then I tried to argue
its importance, and realised that understanding its importance requires
accepting a much larger set of assumptions. I won't fully defend all of these
assumptions, but I think they're mostly important to think about and ideally
deserve separate posts.

{KEY} {HYPOTHESIS}
- Surveillance tech is becoming more powerful and more widespread. {AI} is
enabling automation of the entire pipeline from data collection to analysis to
its usage in offensive actions such as blackmail. Automation allows such
operations to scale up to large sets of targets.

- Surveillance tech stabilises totalitarian regimes and destabilises democratic
ones.

- Advocates of decentralised technology and privacy-preserving technology have
ambitious plans of building an unsurveillable society.

- This dream is sufficiently ambitious and requires so many different things to
go right that it may be worth analysing through the lens of impossibility
results. This means trying to identify the most difficult challenges such
technology faces, and proving results on things it cannot do no matter how hard
it tries.

- {AI} for stylometrics could provide one such impossibility result. Stylometrics
is the study of linguistic style. In this post it is being used primarily in the
context of doxxing anonymous individuals.

{SURVEILLANCE} {TECH} {IS} {BECOMING} {MORE} {POWERFUL} {AND} {MORE} {WIDESPREAD}
Here's a shortened version of some of the claims from The Global Expansion of {AI}
Surveillance by Steven Feldstein, Carnegie Endowment:

- {AI} surveillance technology is spreading at a faster rate to a wider range of
countries than experts have commonly understood. At least seventy-five out of
176 countries globally are actively using {AI} technologies for surveillance
purposes.

- China is a major driv},

Abject poverty in the world is declining. Both the number of people and, of course, the percentage of the world’s population living in poverty is declining at a rate never seen in history. This is great news.But the sheer number of people getting by on \$2.50 a day or less remains staggering. It’s over 3 billion people.While many organizations perform invaluable work attempting to address this problem, one of the more overlooked sources of poverty in the developing world is price risk. There are, of course, plenty of risks for the small farmer, but price risk adds to the overall burden.},

	abstract = {The predation problem is arguably the most difficult and controversial part of wild animal suffering. In what follows, I want to make an argument in favor of the idea to herbivorize predators ({HP}). I will not argue for its possibility or feasibility, because natural evolution already led to the herbivorization of some carnivorous species such as the giant panda, the red panda, the spectacled bear and the kinkajou. Here I present a moral argument, with the intention to open a discussion about whether animal welfare effective altruists should consider herbivorizing predators as a cause area. If the argument is sound, it entails that individuals are allowed to, and society has an obligation to apply safe, animal-friendly and effective means (technologies) to herbivorize predators, and at least we should start doing scientific research to look for such technologies.},

The ideas, in brief:

Study future-oriented beliefs in certain religions or groups
Study the ways in which incidental qualities become essential to institutions
Explore fiction as a tool for moral circle expansion
Study how longtermists use different forms of media and how this might be improved
Study how non-{EAs} actually view {AI} safety issues, and how we got here
Produce anthropological/ethnographic studies of unusually relevant groups
Apply insights from education, history, and development studies to creating a post-societal-collapse recovery plan
Study notions of utopias
Analyze social media (and online forums) in the context of longtermism
Use tools from non-history humanities fields to aid history-oriented projects relevant for longtermism},

Poverty is strongly correlated with economic development (urbanization, industrialization, etc), so encouraging development would have large effects on poverty. Whereas cash transfers have a large probability of a small effect, promoting  growth has a small probability of a large effect. (In general, we should diversify across high- and low-risk strategies.)
