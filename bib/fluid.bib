To prepare for these decisions, we investigate how developers could make a 'safety case,' which is a structured rationale that {AI} systems are unlikely to cause a catastrophe. We propose a framework for organizing a safety case and discuss four categories of arguments to justify safety: total inability to cause a catastrophe, sufficiently strong control measures, trustworthiness despite capability to cause harm, and -- if {AI} systems become much more powerful -- deference to credible {AI} advisors. We evaluate concrete examples of arguments in each category and outline how arguments could be combined to justify that {AI} systems are safe to deploy.},

@online{Woods2022ParableOfBoy,
abstract = {Epistemic status: a parable making a moderately strong claim about {statisticsOnce} upon a time, there was a boy who cried, "there's a 5\% chance there's a wolf!" The villagers came running, saw no wolf, and said "He said there was a wolf and there was not. Thus his probabilities are wrong and he's an alarmist."On the second day, the boy heard some rustling in the bushes and cried "there's a 5\% chance there's a wolf!"Some villagers ran out and some did not. There was no wolf. The wolf-skeptics who stayed in bed felt smug. "That boy is always saying there is a wolf, but there isn't.""I didn't say there was a wolf!" cried the boy. "I was estimating the probability at low, but high enough. A false alarm is much less costly than a missed detection when it comes to dying! The expected value is good!"The villagers didn't understand the boy and ignored him.On the third day, the boy heard some sounds he couldn't identify but seemed wolf-y. "There's a 5\% chance there's a wolf!" he cried. No villagers came.It was a wolf. They were all eaten.Because the villagers did not think probabilistically.The moral of the story is that we should expect to have a large number of false alarms before a catastrophe hits and that is not strong evidence against impending but improbable catastrophe. Each time somebody put a low but high enough probability on a pandemic being about to start, they weren't wrong when it didn't pan out. H1N1 and {SARS} and so forth didn't become global pandemics. But they could have. They had a low probability, but high enough to raise alarms.The problem is that people then thought to themselves "Look! People freaked out about those last ones and it was fine, so people are terrible at predictions and alarmist and we shouldn't worry about pandemics"And then {COVID}-19 happened.This will happen again for other things. People will be raising the alarm about something, and in the media, the nuanced thinking about probabilities will be washed out. You'll hear people saying that X will definitely fuck everything up very soon. And it doesn't.And when the catastrophe doesn't happen, don't over-update. Don't say, "They cried wolf before and nothing happened, thus they are no longer credible."Say "I wonder what probability they or I should put on it? Is that high enough to set up the proper precautions?"When somebody says that nuclear war hasn't happened yet despite all the scares, when somebody reminds you about the {AI} winter where nothing was happening in it despite all the hype, remember the boy who cried a 5\% chance of wolf.Originally posted on my Twitter and personal blog.Reminder that if this reaches 25 upvotes, you can listen to this post on your podcast player using the Nonlinear Library.},

Claude also kindly offered to take the blame for all the mistakes I might have made.{IntroductionQuestion}: How do you figure out how to do the most good with your career?Answer: Find an {EA} sorting hat[1]. Place it on your head. Let it read your mind. Listen carefully as it assigns you your chosen career track, or better yet, a specific role at a specific organisation. Well done. Work hard at your designated job and watch as the impact rolls in.Wrinkle: There is no {EA} sorting hat. There is no omniscient individual or entity that will hear about your degree, your skills, your preferences, and your context, and spit out an ideal career.Obviously this is a caricature. But I think there’s some truth to it. I think it looks like buying into the ideas of {EA}, and then hoping or expecting that the community or some organisation in it can match you with the right career path or job role.Maybe you see some of yourself in this pattern of thinking. Or you might know someone who is making this mistake. I see it happening too much in the {EA} community, especially among those newer to {EA}, and earlier in their career. This is a mistake that 80,000 Hours regularly tries to push back against. But their products are just too good so people still (sometimes) hope that an advising call and studious checking of the job board will solve the pernicious problem of how to craft an impactful career.I don’t think it’s a very interesting anecdote, but I definitely committed an egregious version of this at least once: I updated way too much on literally 5 minutes of advice from someone who worked at 80,000 hours over a beer. I treated his words as some kind of magic insight that I was on the right path. In hindsight, this was obviously bad judgment on my part.Why there isn’t an {EA} sorting {hatI} heard a lot of smart {EAs} tell me to take their advice with a grain of salt. For a while, I used to think this was just false modesty. Their advice was gold and much better than whatever silly thoughts I had floating around in my baby {EA} head. I was a fool. They were right.

@online{Hashim2023EaWins2023,
abstract = {Crossposted from Twitter.As the year comes to an end, we want to highlight and celebrate some of the incredible achievements from in and around the effective altruism ecosystem this year. 1. A new malaria {vaccineThe} World Health Organization recommended its second-ever malaria vaccine this year: R21/Matrix-M, designed to protect babies and young children from malaria. The drug’s recently concluded Phase {III} trial, which was co-funded by Open Philanthropy, found that the vaccine was between 68-75\% effective at targeting the disease, which kills around 600,000 people (mainly children) each year.The work didn’t stop there, though. Following advocacy from many people — including Zacharia Kafuko of 1 Day Sooner — the {WHO} quickly prequalified the vaccine, laying the groundwork for an expedited deployment and potentially saving hundreds of thousands of children’s lives. 1 Day Sooner is now working to raise money to expedite the deployment further. 2. The Supreme Court upholds an animal welfare {lawIn} 2018, Californians voted for Proposition 12 — a bill that banned intensive cage confinement and the sale of animal products from animals in intensive confinement. The meat industry challenged the law for being unconstitutional — but in May of this year, the {US} Supreme Court upheld Prop 12, a decision that will improve the lives of millions of animals who would otherwise be kept in cruel and inhumane conditions.Organizations such as The Humane League — one of Animal Charity Evaluators’ top charities — are a major part of this victory; their tireless campaigning is part of what made Prop 12 happen.Watch a panel discussion featuring The Humane League at {EAG} London 2023 here. 3. {AI} safety goes mainstream2023 was the year {AI} safety went mainstream. After years of work from people in and around effective altruism, this year saw hundreds of high-profile {AI} experts — including two Turing Award winners — say that “mitigating the risk of extinction from {AI} should be a global priority”.That was followed by a flurry of activity from policymakers, including a {US} Executive Order, an international {AI} Safety Summit, the establishment of the {UK} Frontier {AI} Taskforce, and a deal on the {EU} {AI} Act — which, thanks to the efforts of campaigners, is now going to regulate foundation models that pose a systemic risk to society.Important progress was made in technical {AI} safety, too, including work on adversarial robustness, mechanistic interpretability, and lie detection.Watch a talk from {EAG} Boston 2023 on technical {AI} safety here. 4. Results from the world’s largest {UBI} {studySince} 2018, {GiveDirectly} — an organization that distributes direct cash transfers to those in need — has been running the world’s largest universal basic income experiment in rural Kenya.In September, researchers led by {MIT} economist Taveneet Suri and Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee, published their latest analysis of the data — finding that giving people money as a lump sum leads to better results than dispersing it via monthly payments. Long-term {UBI} was also found to be highly effective and didn’t discourage work. The results could have significant implications for how governments disburse cash aid.Watch {GiveDirectly}’s talk at {EAGx} Nordics 2023. 5.

@online{Parra2024QuantifyingGlobalBurden,
abstract = {Warning: This post discusses statistics about extreme pain that may be distressing. While cluster headaches are a neglected, high-impact issue, understanding their true burden requires appreciating the intensity of suffering involved. The pain often reaches levels far beyond typical human experience, making subjective accounts a valuable datapoint until we have robust methods for quantifying pain intensity. For further context, links to firsthand accounts are provided in the footnote[1].You no longer have a headache, or pain located at a particular site: you are literally plunged into the pain, like in a swimming pool. There is only one thing that remains of you: your agitated lucidity and the pain that invades everything, takes everything. There is nothing but pain. At that point, you would give everything, including your head, your own life, to make it stop.- Yves, cluster headache patient from France (from Rossi et al., 2018)Key {takeawaysCluster} headaches are often considered among the most painful conditions known to medicine, if not the most painful (Nesbitt \& Goadsby, 2012). Patients describe the pain as “devilish”, “grueling”, “unbearable” or “so violent that it is utterly intolerable” (Torelli \& Manzoni, 2003), and rate it as significantly more painful than labor pain, gunshot wounds, or fractured bones, among others (Burish et al., 2021).Approximately 1 in 1,000 people worldwide will experience the excruciating pain of cluster headaches during their lifetime (Schindler \& Burish, 2022). In any given year, 1.5 million to 5.6 million (median: 3.0 million) adults are affected.We aggregated statistical data from a couple dozen papers on the prevalence, frequency, duration, and intensity of cluster headaches to estimate their global pain burden.We estimate that all cluster headache patients worldwide spend {\textasciitilde}74,200 person-years per year in pain at any intensity, of which {\textasciitilde}46,200 are spent at ≥7/10 pain and {\textasciitilde}13,600 at ≥9/10 pain—that’s nearly 5 million person-days of extreme suffering (≥9/10 pain) annually.Drawing from research on the heavy-tailed nature of pain intensity (Gómez-Emilsson \& Percy, 2023), our numerical simulations show one way in which a straightforward aggregationist calculation[2] means cluster headaches become a top global health priority. In particular, we compare the burden of cluster headaches with that of migraine, which is the 4th largest source of Years Lived with Disability ({YLD}) worldwide and 19th largest source of {DALY} ({GBD}, 2024).You can access the full simulations here: cluster-headaches.streamlit.{appThe} fact that the prevalence of cluster headaches is much lower than that of other major diseases is actually advantageous and presents an attractive opportunity: we can get rid of a significant proportion of the most extreme human suffering worldwide at a small fraction of the cost of addressing more prevalent conditions.Philanthropists, donors, charity and tech entrepreneurs, policymakers, and other decision-makers should consider cluster headache relief a strong contender for directing their altruistic efforts. This is particularly true for individuals who care about alleviating the most extreme forms of suffering, but the case can be compelling from nearly any ethical perspective.1.

@online{Hutchinson2018KeepingAbsolutesIn,
abstract = {As effective altruists, we often focus on the relative value of the different ways we could be helping others. We focus on particular charities being more effective than others, or particular jobs being more impactful than others. That makes a lot of sense: there are big differences in effectiveness between interventions, so satisficing could lead to us losing a lot of value. But at the end of the day what really matters isn’t relative: it’s the absolute value our actions bring about. What matters is the number of children who are actually dewormed and the actual increases in global security caused by improvements made to technology policy. Keeping that in mind can be important for keeping ourselves motivated and appreciating the work others are putting in.  It might appear that focusing on relative value is unproblematic, even if it isn’t what ultimately matters. But doing so neglects one of the most exciting things about effective altruism: the fact that each of us can actually have a remarkable amount of impact in improving the lives of others. Thinking only about the comparative impact of actions can lead us to overlook that fact. Say I apply for the job I think will have the highest impact but fail to get it. Later, I dwell on how much less impactful my current job is than the one I first went for, instead of on the impact I’m actually having. Or maybe I work on trying to decrease pandemic risk. While I succeed in reducing pandemic risk, the reduction feels tiny compared to the massive reduction in risk the President could effect. In both cases, I’m likely to feel demotivated about my job. Similarly, were it other people in these roles, my attention being on the comparisons might prevent me from properly appreciating the work they’re doing. Focusing on relative value might also lead us to neglect possible costs. When buying houses, people tend to switch into a mode where saving an extra £100 seems less important than it would under ordinary circumstances. Similarly, in large organisations (such as universities) where the costs of activities are high, there may be an assumption that additional overhead costs are unimportant as long as they’re small relative to core activities. Yet in absolute terms, these costs may be thousands of pounds.In cases like those above, it might help to think more about the absolute benefit our actions produce. That might mean simply trying to make the value more salient by thinking about it. The 10\% of my income that I donate is far less than that of some of my friends. But thinking through the fact that over my life I’ll be able to do the equivalent of save more than one person from dying of malaria is still absolutely incredible to me. Calculating the effects in more detail can be even more powerful – in this case thinking through specifically how many lives saved equivalent my career donations might amount to. Similarly,},

@online{Yudkowsky2007BottomLineLesswrong,
abstract = {There are two sealed boxes up for auction, box A and box B. One and only one of these boxes contains a valuable diamond. There are all manner of signs and portents indicating whether a box contains a diamond; but I have no sign which I know to be perfectly reliable. There is a blue stamp on one box, for example, and I know that boxes which contain diamonds are more likely than empty boxes to show a blue stamp. Or one box has a shiny surface, and I have a suspicion—I am not sure—that no diamond-containing box is ever shiny.

  Now suppose there is a clever arguer, holding a sheet of paper, and they say to the owners of box A and box B: “Bid for my services, and whoever wins my services, I shall argue that their box contains the diamond, so that the box will receive a higher price.” So the box-owners bid, and box B’s owner bids higher, winning the services of the clever arguer.

  The clever arguer begins to organize their thoughts. First, they write, “And therefore, box B contains the diamond!” at the bottom of their sheet of paper. Then, at the top of the paper, the clever arguer writes, “Box B shows a blue stamp,” and beneath it, “Box A is shiny,” and then, “Box B is lighter than box A,” and so on through many signs and portents; yet the clever arguer neglects all those signs which might argue in favor of box A. And then the clever arguer comes to me and recites from their sheet of paper: “Box B shows a blue stamp, and box A is shiny,” and so on, until they reach: “and therefore, box B contains the diamond.”

  But consider: At the moment when the clever arguer wrote down their conclusion, at the moment they put ink on their sheet of paper, the evidential entanglement of that physical ink with the physical boxes became fixed.

  It may help to visualize a collection of worlds—Everett branches or Tegmark duplicates—within which there is some objective frequency at which box A or box B contains a diamond.1

  The ink on paper is formed into odd shapes and curves, which look like this text: “And therefore, box B contains the diamond.” If you happened to be a literate English speaker, you might become confused, and think that this shaped ink somehow meant that box B contained the diamond. Subjects instructed to say the color of printed pictures and shown the word Green in red ink often say “green” instead of “red.” It helps to be illiterate, so that you are not confused by the shape of the ink.

  To us, the true import of a thing is its entanglement with other things. Consider again the collection of worlds, Everett branches or Tegmark duplicates. At the moment when all clever arguers in all worlds put ink to the},

@online{Yudkowsky2008FallacyOfGray,
abstract = {The Sophisticate: “The world isn’t black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. It’s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.”

    The Zetet: “Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view . . .”

    —Marc Stiegler, David’s Sling

  I don’t know if the Sophisticate’s mistake has an official name, but I call it the Fallacy of Gray. We saw it manifested in the previous essay—the one who believed that odds of two to the power of seven hundred and fifty million to one, against, meant “there was still a chance.” All probabilities, to him, were simply “uncertain” and that meant he was licensed to ignore them if he pleased.

  “The Moon is made of green cheese” and “the Sun is made of mostly hydrogen and helium” are both uncertainties, but they are not the same uncertainty.

  Everything is shades of gray, but there are shades of gray so light as to be very nearly white, and shades of gray so dark as to be very nearly black. Or even if not, we can still compare shades, and say “it is darker” or “it is lighter.”

  Years ago, one of the strange little formative moments in my career as a rationalist was reading this paragraph from Player of Games by Iain M. Banks, especially the sentence in bold:

    A guilty system recognizes no innocents. As with any power apparatus which thinks everybody’s either for it or against it, we’re against it. You would be too, if you thought about it. The very way you think places you amongst its enemies. This might not be your fault, because every society imposes some of its values on those raised within it, but the point is that some societies try to maximize that effect, and some try to minimize it. You come from one of the latter and you’re being asked to explain yourself to one of the former. Prevarication will be more difficult than you might imagine; neutrality is probably impossible. You cannot choose not to have the politics you do; they are not some separate set of entities somehow detachable from the rest of your being; they are a function of your existence. I know that and they know that; you had better accept it.

  Now, don’t write angry comments saying that, if societies impose fewer of their values, then each succeeding generation has more work to start over from scratch. That’s not what I got out of the paragraph.

  What I got out of the paragraph was something which seems so obvious in retrospect that I could have conceivably picked it up in a hundred},
