                  student assignment mechanism. Education literature
                  provides guidance for the design of such mechanisms
                  but does not offer specific mechanisms. The flaws in
                  the existing school choice plans result in appeals
                  by unsatisfied parents. We formulate the school
                  choice problem as a mechanism design problem and
                  analyze some of the existing school choice plans
                  including those in Boston, Columbus, Minneapolis,
                  and Seattle. We show that these existing plans have
                  serious shortcomings, and offer two alternative
                  mechanisms each of which may provide a practical
                  solution to some critical school choice issues.},

@thesis{Beckstead2013OverwhelmingImportanceShaping,
	database = {Tlön},
	title = {On the overwhelming importance of shaping the far
                  future},
	abstract = {{DescriptionIn} slogan form, the thesis of this
                  dissertation is that shaping the far future is
                  overwhelmingly important. More precisely, I argue
                  that: Main Thesis: From a global perspective, what
                  matters most (in expectation) is that we do what is
                  best (in expectation) for the general trajectory along
                  which our descendants develop over the coming
                  millions, billions, and trillions of years. The first
                  chapter introduces some key concepts, clarifies the
                  main thesis, and outlines what follows in later
                  chapters. Some of the key concepts include:
                  existential risk, the world's development trajectory,
                  proximate benefits and ripple effects, speeding up
                  development, trajectory changes, and the distinction
                  between broad and targeted attempts to shape the far
                  future. The second chapter is a defense of some
                  methodological assumptions for developing normative
                  theories which makes my thesis more plausible. In the
                  third chapter, I introduce and begin to defend some
                  key empirical and normative assumptions which, if
                  true, strongly support my main thesis. In the fourth
                  and fifth chapters, I argue against two of the
                  strongest objections to my arguments. These objections
                  come from population ethics, and are based on
                  Person-Affecting Views and views according to which
                  additional lives have diminishing marginal value. I
                  argue that these views face extreme difficulties and
                  cannot plausibly be used to rebut my arguments. In the
                  sixth and seventh chapters, I discuss a
                  decision-theoretic paradox which is relevant to my
                  arguments. The simplest plausible theoretical
                  assumptions which support my main thesis imply a view
                  I call fanaticism, according to which any non-zero
                  probability of an infinitely good outcome, no matter
                  how small, is better than any probability of a
                  finitely good outcome. I argue that denying fanaticism
                  is inconsistent with other normative principles that
                  seem very obvious, so that we are faced with a
                  paradox. I have no solution to the paradox; I instead
                  argue that we should continue to use our inconsistent
                  principles, but we should use them tastefully. We
                  should do this because, currently, we know of no
                  consistent set of principles which does better.},

                  morally?},
	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8233},
	abstract = {Artificial reinforcement learning ({RL}) is a widely
                  used technique in artificial intelligence that
                  provides a general method for training agents to
                  perform a wide variety of behaviours. {RL} as used in
                  computer science has striking parallels to reward and
                  punishment learning in animal and human brains. I
                  argue that present-day artificial {RL} agents have a
                  very small but nonzero degree of ethical importance.
                  This is particularly plausible for views according to
                  which sentience comes in degrees based on the
                  abilities and complexities of minds, but even binary
                  views on consciousness should assign nonzero
                  probability to {RL} programs having morally relevant
                  experiences. While {RL} programs are not a top ethical
                  priority today, they may become more significant in
                  the coming decades as {RL} is increasingly applied to
                  industry, robotics, video games, and other areas. I
                  encourage scientists, philosophers, and citizens to
                  begin a conversation about our ethical duties to
                  reduce the harm that we inflict on powerless,
                  voiceless {RL} agents.},
