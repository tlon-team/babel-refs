	abstract = {Is there something distinctive about humanity that
                  justifies the ideathat humans have moral status while
                  non-humans do not? Providing ananswer to this question
                  has become increasingly important amongphilosophers as
                  well as those outside of philosophy who are
                  interestedin our treatment of non-human animals. For
                  some, answering thisquestion will enable us to better
                  understand the nature of humanbeings and the proper
                  scope of our moral obligations. Some argue thatthere
                  is an answer that can distinguish humans from the rest
                  of thenatural world. Many of those who accept this
                  answer are interested injustifying certain human
                  practices towards non-humans-practicesthat cause pain,
                  discomfort, suffering and death. This latter
                  groupexpects that in answering the question in a
                  particular way, humanswill be justified in granting
                  moral consideration to other humans thatis neither
                  required nor justified when considering non-human
                  animals.In contrast to this view, an increasing number
                  of philosophers haveargued that while humans are
                  different in a variety of ways from eachother and
                  other animals, these differences do not provide
                  aphilosophical defense for denying non-human animals
                  moralconsideration. What the basis of moral
                  consideration is and what itamounts to has been the
                  source of much disagreement.},
