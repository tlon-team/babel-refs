                  ({RCTs}) on long-run economic productivity and
                  living standards in poor countries. We first
                  document that several studies estimate large
                  positive long-run impacts, but that relatively few
                  existing {RCTs} have been evaluated over the long
                  run. We next present evidence from a systematic
                  survey of existing {RCTs}, with a focus on cash
                  transfer and child health programs, and show that a
                  meaningful subset can realistically be evaluated for
                  long-run effects. We discuss ways to bridge the gap
                  between the burgeoning number of development {RCTs}
                  and the limited number that have been followed up to
                  date, including through new panel (longitudinal)
                  data; improved participant tracking methods;
                  alternative research designs; and access to
                  administrative, remote sensing, and cell phone data.
                  We conclude that the rise of development economics
                  {RCTs} since roughly 2000 provides a novel
                  opportunity to generate high-quality evidence on the

                  states, including pains, pleasures, emotions, moods,
                  and feelings of desire or repulsion.This paper has
                  two main goals. One is to suggest that enough is now
                  known about the causes, consequences, and properties
                  of valence to indicate that it forms a unitary
                  natural-psychological kind, one that seemingly plays
                  a fundamental role in motivating all kinds of
                  intentional action. If this turns out to be true,
                  then the correct characterization of the nature of
                  valence becomes an urgent philosophical issue. There
                  appear to be just two accounts that have the
                  required generality. According to one, valence is a
                  nonconceptual representation of value. According to
                  the other, valence is an intrinsic qualitative
                  property of experience. (Both views maintain that
                  valence is directly motivating.) The second goal of
                  the paper is to contrast and evaluate these two
                  views of the nature of valence, drawing on the
                  relevant empirical findings. Overall, I suggest that
                  the representational account is more plausible.},

	abstract = {Abstract Some charities are much more cost-effective
                  than other charities, which means that they can save
                  many more lives with the same amount of money. Yet
                  most donations do not go to the most effective
                  charities. Why is that? We hypothesized that part of
                  the reason is that people underestimate how much more
                  effective the most effective charities are compared
                  with the average charity. Thus, they do not know how
                  much more good they could do if they donated to the
                  most effective charities. We studied this hypothesis
                  using samples of the general population, students,
                  experts, and effective altruists in five studies. We
                  found that lay people estimated that among charities
                  helping the global poor, the most effective charities
                  are 1.5 times more effective than the average charity
                  (Studies 1 and 2). Effective altruists, in contrast,
                  estimated the difference to be factor 50 (Study 3) and
                  experts estimated the factor to be 100 (Study 4). We
                  found that participants donated more to the most
                  effective charity, and less to an average charity,
                  when informed about the large difference in
                  cost-effectiveness (Study 5). In conclusion,
                  misconceptions about the difference in effectiveness
                  between charities is thus likely one reason, among
                  many, why people donate ineffectively.},

                  what extent can responses to sacrificial dilemmas
                  shed light on utilitarian decision making? We
                  consider two key questions. First, how meaningful is
                  the relationship between responses to sacrificial
                  dilemmas, and what is distinctive about a
                  utilitarian approach to morality? Second, to what
                  extent do findings about sacrificial dilemmas
                  generalize to other moral contexts where there is
                  tension between utilitarianism and common-sense
                  intuitions? We argue that sacrificial dilemmas only
                  capture one point of conflict between utilitarianism
                  and common-sense morality, and new paradigms will be
                  necessary to investigate other key aspects of
                  utilitarianism, such as its radical impartiality.},

                  environment across generations. Within these models,
                  when the environment is more stable across

                  measures across 20-year generations from 500 to

	issn = {1556-5068},
	doi = {10.2139/ssrn.3398303},
	abstract = {A large literature on persistence finds that many
                  modern outcomes strongly reflect characteristics of
                  the same places in the distant past. However,
                  alongside unusually high t statistics, these
                  regressions display severe spatial autocorrelation
                  in residuals, and the purpose of this paper is to
                  examine whether these two properties might be
                  connected. We start by running artificial
                  regressions where both variables are spatial noise
                  and find that, even for modest ranges of spatial
                  correlation between points, t statistics become
                  severely inflated leading to significance levels
                  that are in error by several orders of magnitude. We
                  analyse 27 persistence studies in leading journals
                  and find that in most cases if we replace the main
                  explanatory variable with spatial noise the fit of
                  the regression commonly improves; and if we replace
                  the dependent variable with spatial noise, the
                  persistence variable can still explain it at high
                  significance levels. We can predict in advance which
                  persistence results might be the outcome of fitting
                  spatial noise from the degree of spatial
                  autocorrelation in their residuals measured by a
                  standard Moran statistic. Our findings suggest that
                  the results of persistence studies, and of spatial
                  regressions more generally, might be treated with
                  some caution in the absence of reported Moran
                  statistics and noise simulations.},

	url = {https://scholarship.law.vanderbilt.edu/vlr/vol59/iss5/2},
	abstract = {Neuroscientists have made significant advances in
                  identifying drugs to dampen the intensity of
                  traumatic memories. Such drugs hold promise for
                  victims of terrorism, military conflict, assault,
                  car accidents, and natural disasters who might
                  otherwise suffer for many years from intense,
                  painful memories. In 2003, the President's Council
                  on Bioethics released a report, entitled Beyond
                  Therapy: Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness,
                  which analyzed memory dampening in some detail.
                  While the Council acknowledged the potential
                  benefits of memory dampening, some Council members
                  were concerned that it may: (1) discourage us from
                  authentically coping with trauma, (2) tamper with
                  personal identity, (3) demean the genuineness of
                  human life and experience, (4) encourage us to
                  forget memories that we are obligated to keep, and
                  (5) inure us to the pain of others. In this Article,
                  I describe possible legal and ethical implications
                  of memory dampening. For example, I note that
                  traumatic events frequently lead to legal
                  proceedings that rely on memories of those events.
                  Drugs that dampen traumatic memories may someday
                  test the boundaries between an individual's right to
                  modify his memories and society's right to stop him
                  from altering valuable evidence. More broadly, I
                  respond to the Council by arguing that many of its
                  concerns are founded on controversial premises that
                  unjustifiably privilege our natural cognitive
                  abilities. While memory dampening may eventually
                  require thoughtful regulation, broad-brushed
                  restrictions are unjustified: We have a deeply
                  personal interest in controlling our own minds that
                  entitles us to a certain freedom of memory.},

                  sophisticated text data mining (categorizing and
                  clustering using words and multiword phrases) in
                  conjunction with {NIH}-wide definitions used to
                  match projects to categories. {RCDC} use of data
                  mining improves consistency and eliminates the wide
                  variability in defining the research categories
                  reported. The definitions are a list of terms and
                  concepts selected by {NIH} scientific experts to
                  define a research category. The research category
                  levels represent the {NIH}’s best estimates based on
                  the category definitions. The {NIH} does not
                  expressly budget by category. The annual estimates
                  reflect amounts that change as a result of science,
                  actual research projects funded, and the {NIH}
                  budget. The research categories are not mutually
                  exclusive. Individual research projects can be
                  included in multiple categories so amounts depicted
                  within each column of this table do not add up to
                  100 percent of {NIH}-funded research. Consistent
                  with the Administration’s emphasis on transparency,
                  two separate columns are used to distinguish {FY}
                  2009 and {FY} 2010 actual support funded from
                  American Recovery \& Reinvestment Act ({ARRA})
                  accounts from projects funded by regular {NIH}
                  appropriations. The table shows historical data for
                  {FY} 2009 through {FY} 2012. The {FY} 2013-2014
                  estimates are based on {RCDC} actual data. Total

                  predict how much they would change in the next
                  decade. Young people, middle-aged people, and older

	isbn = {978-0-19-959966-0},
	shorttitle = {Zoopolis},
	abstract = {Zoopolis offers a new agenda for the theory and
                  practice of animal rights. Most animal rights theory
                  focuses on the intrinsic capacities or interests of
                  animals, and the moral status and moral rights that
                  these intrinsic characteristics give rise to.
                  Zoopolis shifts the debate from the realm of moral
                  theory and applied ethics to the realm of political
                  theory, focusing on the relational obligations that
                  arise from the varied ways that animals relate to
                  human societies and institutions. Building on recent
                  developments in the political theory of
                  group-differentiated citizenship, Zoopolis
                  introduces us to the genuine 'political animal'. It
                  argues that different types of animals stand in
                  different relationships to human political
                  communities. Domesticated animals should be seen as
                  full members of human-animal mixed communities,
                  participating in the cooperative project of shared
                  citizenship. Wilderness animals, by contrast, form
                  their own sovereign communities entitled to
                  protection against colonization, invasion,
                  domination, and other threats to self-determination.
                  'Liminal' animals who are wild but live in the midst
                  of human settlement (such as crows or raccoons)
                  should be seen as 'denizens', residents of our
                  societies, but not fully included in rights and
                  responsibilities of citizenship. To all of these
                  animals we owe respect for their basic inviolable
                  rights, but we inevitably and appropriately have
                  very different relations with them, with different
                  types of obligations. Humans and animals are
                  inextricably bound in a complex web of
                  relationships, and Zoopolis offers an original and
                  profoundly affirmative vision of how to ground this
                  complex web of relations on principles of justice
                  and compassion.},

	abstract = {It is increasingly common for social scientists to
                  describe political processes as “path dependent.”
                  The concept, however, is often employed without
                  careful elaboration. This article conceptualizes
                  path dependence as a social process grounded in a
                  dynamic of “increasing returns.” Reviewing recent
                  literature in economics and suggesting extensions to
                  the world of politics, the article demonstrates that
                  increasing returns processes are likely to be
                  prevalent, and that good analytical foundations
                  exist for exploring their causes and consequences.
                  The investigation of increasing returns can provide
                  a more rigorous framework for developing some of the
                  key claims of recent scholarship in historical
                  institutionalism: Specific patterns of timing and
                  sequence matter; a wide range of social outcomes may
                  be possible; large consequences may result from
                  relatively small or contingent events; particular
                  courses of action, once introduced, can be almost
                  impossible to reverse; and consequently, political
                  development is punctuated by critical moments or
                  junctures that shape the basic contours of social
                  life.},

                  to proteins is an important task that falls outside
                  the domain of applicability of most small molecule
                  and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the
                  small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide
                  on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and
                  systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by
                  enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides.
                  In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by
                  post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent
                  {MM}- {GBSA} calculations. Using the best {RMSD}
                  among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the
                  success rate ({RMSD} ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface
                  backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default
                  Glide {SP} settings to 58\% with the enhanced
                  peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of
                  redocking to the native protein structure. This
                  approaches the accuracy of the recently developed
                  Rosetta {FlexPepDock} method (63\% success for these
                  19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster.
                  Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases
                  where an unbound receptor structure was available,
                  and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked
                  successfully. We analyze the results and find that
                  the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate
                  for extended peptides of limited size and number of
                  formal charges, defining a domain of applicability
                  for this approach.},

Further, optimal precaution against{\textbackslash}nuncommons risks requires careful analysis to avoid misplaced priorities{\textbackslash}nand potentially catastrophic risk-risk trade-offs.

                  that goal misgeneralization can occur in practical
                  systems by providing several examples in deep
                  learning systems across a variety of domains.
                  Extrapolating forward to more capable systems, we
                  provide hypotheticals that illustrate how goal
                  misgeneralization could lead to catastrophic risk.
                  We suggest several research directions that could
                  reduce the risk of goal misgeneralization for future
                  systems.},

            Atmospheric soot loadings from nuclear weapon detonation would cause disruptions to the Earth’s climate, limiting terrestrial and aquatic food production. Here, we use climate, crop and fishery models to estimate the impacts arising from six scenarios of stratospheric soot injection, predicting the total food calories available in each nation post-war after stored food is consumed. In quantifying impacts away from target areas, we demonstrate that soot injections larger than 5 Tg would lead to mass food shortages, and livestock and aquatic food production would be unable to compensate for reduced crop output, in almost all countries. Adaptation measures such as food waste reduction would have limited impact on increasing available calories. We estimate more than 2 billion people could die from nuclear war between India and Pakistan, and more than 5 billion could die from a war between the United States and Russia—underlining the importance of global cooperation in preventing nuclear war.},
