                  ({RCTs}) on long-run economic productivity and
                  living standards in poor countries. We first
                  document that several studies estimate large
                  positive long-run impacts, but that relatively few
                  existing {RCTs} have been evaluated over the long
                  run. We next present evidence from a systematic
                  survey of existing {RCTs}, with a focus on cash
                  transfer and child health programs, and show that a
                  meaningful subset can realistically be evaluated for
                  long-run effects. We discuss ways to bridge the gap
                  between the burgeoning number of development {RCTs}
                  and the limited number that have been followed up to
                  date, including through new panel (longitudinal)
                  data; improved participant tracking methods;
                  alternative research designs; and access to
                  administrative, remote sensing, and cell phone data.
                  We conclude that the rise of development economics
                  {RCTs} since roughly 2000 provides a novel
                  opportunity to generate high-quality evidence on the

                  states, including pains, pleasures, emotions, moods,
                  and feelings of desire or repulsion.This paper has
                  two main goals. One is to suggest that enough is now
                  known about the causes, consequences, and properties
                  of valence to indicate that it forms a unitary
                  natural-psychological kind, one that seemingly plays
                  a fundamental role in motivating all kinds of
                  intentional action. If this turns out to be true,
                  then the correct characterization of the nature of
                  valence becomes an urgent philosophical issue. There
                  appear to be just two accounts that have the
                  required generality. According to one, valence is a
                  nonconceptual representation of value. According to
                  the other, valence is an intrinsic qualitative
                  property of experience. (Both views maintain that
                  valence is directly motivating.) The second goal of
                  the paper is to contrast and evaluate these two
                  views of the nature of valence, drawing on the
                  relevant empirical findings. Overall, I suggest that
                  the representational account is more plausible.},

	abstract = {Abstract Some charities are much more cost-effective
                  than other charities, which means that they can save
                  many more lives with the same amount of money. Yet
                  most donations do not go to the most effective
                  charities. Why is that? We hypothesized that part of
                  the reason is that people underestimate how much more
                  effective the most effective charities are compared
                  with the average charity. Thus, they do not know how
                  much more good they could do if they donated to the
                  most effective charities. We studied this hypothesis
                  using samples of the general population, students,
                  experts, and effective altruists in five studies. We
                  found that lay people estimated that among charities
                  helping the global poor, the most effective charities
                  are 1.5 times more effective than the average charity
                  (Studies 1 and 2). Effective altruists, in contrast,
                  estimated the difference to be factor 50 (Study 3) and
                  experts estimated the factor to be 100 (Study 4). We
                  found that participants donated more to the most
                  effective charity, and less to an average charity,
                  when informed about the large difference in
                  cost-effectiveness (Study 5). In conclusion,
                  misconceptions about the difference in effectiveness
                  between charities is thus likely one reason, among
                  many, why people donate ineffectively.},

                  what extent can responses to sacrificial dilemmas
                  shed light on utilitarian decision making? We
                  consider two key questions. First, how meaningful is
                  the relationship between responses to sacrificial
                  dilemmas, and what is distinctive about a
                  utilitarian approach to morality? Second, to what
                  extent do findings about sacrificial dilemmas
                  generalize to other moral contexts where there is
                  tension between utilitarianism and common-sense
                  intuitions? We argue that sacrificial dilemmas only
                  capture one point of conflict between utilitarianism
                  and common-sense morality, and new paradigms will be
                  necessary to investigate other key aspects of
                  utilitarianism, such as its radical impartiality.},

                  environment across generations. Within these models,
                  when the environment is more stable across

                  measures across 20-year generations from 500 to

	issn = {1556-5068},
	doi = {10.2139/ssrn.3398303},
	abstract = {A large literature on persistence finds that many
                  modern outcomes strongly reflect characteristics of
                  the same places in the distant past. However,
                  alongside unusually high t statistics, these
                  regressions display severe spatial autocorrelation
                  in residuals, and the purpose of this paper is to
                  examine whether these two properties might be
                  connected. We start by running artificial
                  regressions where both variables are spatial noise
                  and find that, even for modest ranges of spatial
                  correlation between points, t statistics become
                  severely inflated leading to significance levels
                  that are in error by several orders of magnitude. We
                  analyse 27 persistence studies in leading journals
                  and find that in most cases if we replace the main
                  explanatory variable with spatial noise the fit of
                  the regression commonly improves; and if we replace
                  the dependent variable with spatial noise, the
                  persistence variable can still explain it at high
                  significance levels. We can predict in advance which
                  persistence results might be the outcome of fitting
                  spatial noise from the degree of spatial
                  autocorrelation in their residuals measured by a
                  standard Moran statistic. Our findings suggest that
                  the results of persistence studies, and of spatial
                  regressions more generally, might be treated with
                  some caution in the absence of reported Moran
                  statistics and noise simulations.},

	url = {https://scholarship.law.vanderbilt.edu/vlr/vol59/iss5/2},
	abstract = {Neuroscientists have made significant advances in
                  identifying drugs to dampen the intensity of
                  traumatic memories. Such drugs hold promise for
                  victims of terrorism, military conflict, assault,
                  car accidents, and natural disasters who might
                  otherwise suffer for many years from intense,
                  painful memories. In 2003, the President's Council
                  on Bioethics released a report, entitled Beyond
                  Therapy: Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness,
                  which analyzed memory dampening in some detail.
                  While the Council acknowledged the potential
                  benefits of memory dampening, some Council members
                  were concerned that it may: (1) discourage us from
                  authentically coping with trauma, (2) tamper with
                  personal identity, (3) demean the genuineness of
                  human life and experience, (4) encourage us to
                  forget memories that we are obligated to keep, and
                  (5) inure us to the pain of others. In this Article,
                  I describe possible legal and ethical implications
                  of memory dampening. For example, I note that
                  traumatic events frequently lead to legal
                  proceedings that rely on memories of those events.
                  Drugs that dampen traumatic memories may someday
                  test the boundaries between an individual's right to
                  modify his memories and society's right to stop him
                  from altering valuable evidence. More broadly, I
                  respond to the Council by arguing that many of its
                  concerns are founded on controversial premises that
                  unjustifiably privilege our natural cognitive
                  abilities. While memory dampening may eventually
                  require thoughtful regulation, broad-brushed
                  restrictions are unjustified: We have a deeply
                  personal interest in controlling our own minds that
                  entitles us to a certain freedom of memory.},

                  concepts selected by {NIH} scientific experts to
                  define a research category. The research category
                  levels represent the {NIH}’s best estimates based on
                  the category definitions. The {NIH} does not
                  expressly budget by category. The annual estimates
                  reflect amounts that change as a result of science,
                  actual research projects funded, and the {NIH}
                  budget. The research categories are not mutually
                  exclusive. Individual research projects can be
                  included in multiple categories so amounts depicted
                  within each column of this table do not add up to
                  100 percent of {NIH}-funded research. Consistent
                  with the Administration’s emphasis on transparency,
                  two separate columns are used to distinguish {FY}
                  2009 and {FY} 2010 actual support funded from
                  American Recovery \& Reinvestment Act ({ARRA})
                  accounts from projects funded by regular {NIH}
                  appropriations. The table shows historical data for
                  {FY} 2009 through {FY} 2012. The {FY} 2013-2014
                  estimates are based on {RCDC} actual data. Total

                  predict how much they would change in the next
                  decade. Young people, middle-aged people, and older

                  the person they will be for the rest of their lives.

                  think of things like recycling, fair trade, and
                  volunteering. But that's missing something huge: your
                  choice of career. We believe that what you do with
                  your career is probably the most important ethical
                  decision of your life. The first reason is the huge
                  amount of time at stake.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To study the perspectives of the United States population towards the use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis ({PGD}) in various clinical scenarios. Methods: Online cross-sectional population based questionnaire of a nationally representative sample according to age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, education and religion. Results: A total of 1006 completed the questionnaire with an overall response rate of 94 \%. A majority supported {PGD} for diseases fatal early in life or those causing lifelong disability (72.9 and 66.7 \%, respectively); only 48.0 \% supported {PGD} for diseases that manifest late in life. Respondents were more supportive of {PGD} for genetic diseases if they were aware of {PGD} prior to the survey ({OR} = 1.64; {CI} = 1.13–2.39). However, a small proportion were in favor of genetically-based trait selection: 21.1 \% supported {PGD} for sex selection, 14.6 \% for physical traits and 18.9 \% for personality traits. Compared to women, men were nearly two- to three-fold more supportive of {PGD} for sex selection ({OR} = 1.65; {CI} = 1.20–2.78), physical traits ({OR} = 2.38; {CI} = 1.60–3.48) and personality traits ({OR} = 2.31; {CI} = 1.64–3.26). Compared to Caucasians, Asians ({OR} = 3.87; {CI} = 1.71–8.78) and African Americans ({OR} = 1.61; {CI} = 1.04–2.74) were more supportive of {PGD} for sex selection. Conclusions: In a nationally representative sample, a majority supported {PGD} to identify early onset diseases. We noted significant variation in opinions by sex, race, and education. There was more support among those with prior knowledge of {PGD} suggesting that education about {PGD} may foster favorable opinions. This study identifies public knowledge and attitudes that may be used to shape future research hypotheses and clinical policies.},

	title = {Intrinsic vs. extrinsic value},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/value-intrinsic-extrinsic/},
	abstract = {Intrinsic value has traditionally been thought to lie at the heart of ethics. Philosophers use a number of terms to refer to such value. The intrinsic value of something is said to be the value that that thing has “in itself,” or “for its own sake,” or “as such,” or “in its own right.” Extrinsic value is value that is not intrinsic. Many philosophers take intrinsic value to be crucial to a variety of moral judgments. For example, according to a fundamental form of consequentialism, whether an action is morally right or wrong has exclusively to do with whether its consequences are intrinsically better than those of any other action one can perform under the circumstances. Many other theories also hold that what it is right or wrong to do has at least in part to do with the intrinsic value of the consequences of the actions one can perform. Moreover, if, as is commonly believed, what one is morally responsible for doing is some function of the rightness or wrongness of what one does, then intrinsic value would seem relevant to judgments about responsibility, too. Intrinsic value is also often taken to be pertinent to judgments about moral justice (whether having to do with moral rights or moral desert), insofar as it is good that justice is done and bad that justice is denied, in ways that appear intimately tied to intrinsic value. Finally, it is typically thought that judgments about moral virtue and vice also turn on questions of intrinsic value, inasmuch as virtues are good, and vices bad, again in ways that appear closely connected to such value. All four types of moral judgments have been the subject of discussion since the dawn of western philosophy in ancient Greece. The Greeks themselves were especially concerned with questions about virtue and vice, and the concept of intrinsic value may be found at work in their writings and in the writings of moral philosophers ever since. Despite this fact, and rather surprisingly, it is only within the last one hundred years or so that this concept has itself been the subject of sustained scrutiny, and even within this relatively brief period the scrutiny has waxed and waned.},
