	abstract = {Comment by {CarlShulman} - I agree it's very unlikely
                  that a nuclear war discharging current arsenals could
                  directly cause human extinction. But the conditional
                  probability of extinction given all-out nuclear war
                  can go much higher if the problem gets worse. Some
                  aspects of this: -at the peak of the Cold War arsenals
                  there were over 70,000 nuclear weapons, not 14,000
                  -this Brookings estimate puts spending building the
                  {US} nuclear arsenal at several trillion current
                  dollars, with lower marginal costs per weapon, e.g.
                  \$20M per weapon and \$50-100M all-in for for {ICBMs}
                  -economic growth since then means the world could
                  already afford far larger arsenals in a renewed arms
                  race -current {US} military expenditure is over \$700B
                  annually, about 1/30th of {GDP}; at the peak of the
                  Cold War in the 50s and 60s it was about 1/10th;
                  Soviet expenditure was proportionally higher -so with
                  1950s proportional military expenditures, half going
                  to nukes, the {US} and China could each produce
                  20,000+ {ICBMs}, each of which could be fitted with
                  {MIRVs} and several warheads, building up to millions
                  of warheads over a decade or so; the numbers could be
                  higher for cheaper delivery systems -economies of
                  scale and improvements in technology would likely
                  bring down the per warhead cost -if {AI} and robotics
                  greatly increase economic growth the above numbers
                  could be increased by orders of magnitude -radiation
                  effects could be intentionally greatly increased with
                  alternative warhead composition -all-out discharge of
                  strategic nuclear arsenals is also much more likely to
                  be accompanied by simultaneous deployment of other
                  {WMD}, including pandemic bioweapons (which the
                  Soviets pursued as a strategic weapon for such
                  circumstances)and drone swarms (which might kill
                  survivors in bunkers); the combined effects of future
                  versions of all of these {WMD} at once may
                  synergistically cause extinction},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}I consider whether
                  evolutionary explanations can debunk our moral
                  beliefs. Most contemporary discussion in this area is
                  centred on the question of whether debunking
                  implications follow from our ability to explain
                  elements of human morality in terms of natural
                  selection, given that there has been no selection for
                  true moral beliefs. By considering the most prominent
                  arguments in the literature today, I offer reasons to
                  think that debunking arguments of this kind fail.
                  However, I argue that a successful evolutionary
                  debunking argument can be constructed by appeal to the
                  suggestion that our moral outlook reflects arbitrary
                  contingencies of our phylogeny, much as the horizontal
                  orientation of the whale's tail reflects its descent
                  from terrestrial
                  quadrupeds.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
                  {\textless}p{\textgreater}An introductory chapter
                  unpacks the question of whether evolutionary
                  explanations can debunk our moral beliefs, offers a
                  brief historical guide to the philosophical discussion
                  surrounding it, and explains what I mean to contribute
                  to this discussion. Thereafter follow six chapters and
                  a conclusion. The six chapters are divided into three
                  pairs. The first two chapters consider what
                  contemporary scientific evidence can tell us about the
                  evolutionary origins of morality and, in particular,
                  to what extent the evidence speaks in favour of the
                  claims on which debunking arguments rely. The next two
                  chapters offer a critique of popular debunking
                  arguments that are centred on the irrelevance of moral
                  facts in natural selection explanations. The final
                  chapters develop a novel argument for the claim that
                  evolutionary explanations can undermine our moral
                  beliefs insofar as they show that our moral outlook
                  reflects arbitrary contingencies of our phylogeny. A
                  conclusion summarizes my argument and sets out the key
                  questions that arise in its
                  wake.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

                  Uncertainty},
	abstract = {It has been argued that evolutionary considerations
                  favour utilitarianism by selectively debunking its
                  competitors. However, evolutionary considerations
                  also seem to undermine the practical significance of
                  utilitarianism, since commonsense beliefs about
                  well-being seem like prime candidates for
                  evolutionary debunking. We argue that the practical
                  significance of utilitarianism is not undermined in
                  this way if we understand the requirements of
                  practical rationality as sensitive to normative
                  uncertainty. We consider the view that rational
                  decision-making under normative uncertainty requires
                  maximizing expected choice-worthiness, as well as
                  the possibility that different theories’
                  choice-worthiness rankings are not all
                  interval-scale measurable or intertheoretically
                  comparable. Finally, we suggest how evolutionary
                  considerations may increase the practical
                  significance of utilitarianism even if belief in
                  utilitarianism is debunked by evolutionary
                  considerations, so long as belief in competing
                  theories is undermined to an even greater extent.},

	abstract = {Comment by {RandomEA} - Here are ten reasons you might
                  choose to work on near-term causes. The first five are
                  reasons you might think near term work is more
                  important, while the latter five are why you might
                  work on near term causes even if you think long term
                  future work is more important. 1. You might think the
                  future is likely to be net negative. Click here for
                  why one person initially thought this and here for why
                  another person would be reluctant to support
                  existential risk work (it makes space colonization
                  more likely, which could increase future suffering).
                  2. Your view of population ethics might cause you to
                  think existential risks are relatively unimportant. Of
                  course, if your view was merely a standard person
                  affecting view, it would be subject to the response
                  that work on existential risk is high value even if
                  only the present generation is considered. However,
                  you might go further and adopt an Epicurean view under
                  which it is not bad for a person to die a premature
                  death (meaning that death is only bad to the extent it
                  inflicts suffering on oneself or others). 3. You might
                  have a methodological objection to applying expected
                  value to cases where the probability is small. While
                  the author attributes this view to Holden Karnofsky,
                  Karnofsky now puts much more weight on the view that
                  improving the long term future is valuable. 4. You
                  might think it's hard to predict how the future will
                  unfold and what impact our actions will have. (Note
                  that the post is from five years ago and may no longer
                  reflect the views of the author.) 5. You might think
                  that {AI} is unlikely to be a concern for at least 50
                  years (perhaps based on your conversations with people
                  in the field). Given that ongoing suffering can only
                  be alleviated in the present, you might think it's
                  better to focus on that for now. 6. You might think
                  that when there is an opportunity to have an unusually
                  large impact in the present, you should take},
